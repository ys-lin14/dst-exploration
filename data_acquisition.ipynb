It can be completely unforgiving when you die (the default setting for servers is game over once everyone dies) or you can set it to be resurrected by clicking on the portal (endless). You can run around collecting things and trying not to die. The customization of how many of everything spawns in a server determines how easy or hard the game is and makes for good balance based on player experience level. The developers are consistently working on new DLC and content so it's worth coming back to. There's plenty of enemies to fight and things to build. There's seasons with different challenges to overcome (winter requires warm clothing, summer requires things to cool you off, etc). Mods are easy to implement into the game and keep the replayability high. Overall, a pretty decent game to play by yourself or with a bunch of friends. \n",

Some people have created characters but have caused an error for the game in which it does NOT allow you to start up the server.

So the game is basically a multiplayer online game where the point of it is to go as long as you can without getting killed or dying in some way shape or form. The biggest fault of the game is it gets boring after a few hours so be sure to give mods a chance if you dont like the game itself. The biggest pro of the game is that it is great for having a good time with friends and working together. Overall I think this game is a great buy for anyone who likes survival games. I give this game an 8 out of 10. \n",

      "Each day counts. If you don't work together, chances are you won't survive once autumn ends. If you're not ready for each season, you won't last the full cycle. Each season has a different problem of their own, whether it'd be frostbites, wetness, or extreme heat. The availability of mobs also changes with each season, giving some variety of items and mobs to work with. It's best if you've played on your own first to learn where everything is and how they work before playing with others. This is not a game where you can wing it on the fly. \n",

The best way I can descibe this game is that it's like a survivalist sandbox; more dangerous than minecraft and even though the plot about maxwell isn't implemented in dst, it feels like the game has a direction. The graphics are great and I find the 2.5D style quite charming. Plus the modding community is very strong so there is always new content to try out. \n",
