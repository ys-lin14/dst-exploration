Each time you start a new world you make it slightly further than you did the last time only to die to a new aspect that you never knew before. Takes several times to get a mechanic, but once you do the you can finally start learning the other aspects of the game such as crafting and fighting. Playing with friends makes the game 1000x more enjoyable. This game is a deal breaker I see potential in losing friends over this game :p 11/10 would recommend",1452657532,True

You can build a home base, food and material farms, traps for mobs trying to kill you, clothes to help you survive summer and winter among many other nifty things!  Seasons have different effects on your world such as different mobs acting based on the current seasons, in summer wild fires can occur but fear not as you can protect your base by building ice throwing machines!  Mine rocks for ore for your base and tools but beware meteor fields! One hit and you're dead...  The fun is doubled in multiplayer mode with friends as many crazy things tend to happen... Trust me on this one!  Overall a very recommended purchase you will (most likely) not regret!  Also: Exterminate beefalo herds with traps and be the bad boy!

It can be completely unforgiving when you die (the default setting for servers is game over once everyone dies) or you can set it to be resurrected by clicking on the portal (endless). You can run around collecting things and trying not to die. The customization of how many of everything spawns in a server determines how easy or hard the game is and makes for good balance based on player experience level. The developers are consistently working on new DLC and content so it's worth coming back to. There's plenty of enemies to fight and things to build. There's seasons with different challenges to overcome (winter requires warm clothing, summer requires things to cool you off, etc). Mods are easy to implement into the game and keep the replayability high. Overall, a pretty decent game to play by yourself or with a bunch of friends.",1450912095,True

Some people have created characters but have caused an error for the game in which it does NOT allow you to start up the server.

Its amazing to get on and have your own adventure with friends or people you have never met just beware of the willow trolls.

Ever since, I've been so interested in the characters, the story, the function, the play experience... It sucked me right in, and it's such an immersive experience with quirky characters and equally terrifying mobs.  The Klei Development team themselves seem to be active in he community, on their forums, at least, actively working on updates and bugs, should one ever come up.  The only thing I might add is that... perhaps a DST rendition of Adventure Mode could be added for additional challenge. I can see that being loads of fun.

So the game is basically a multiplayer online game where the point of it is to go as long as you can without getting killed or dying in some way shape or form. The biggest fault of the game is it gets boring after a few hours so be sure to give mods a chance if you dont like the game itself. The biggest pro of the game is that it is great for having a good time with friends and working together. Overall I think this game is a great buy for anyone who likes survival games.

Believe me it's stupid to see someone randomly hitting the air and running around to avoid shadows. - keep yourself healthy - stay out of darkness - make yourself warm during winter - make yourself dry during the rainy days - and fighting random monsters coming to your way  It is a good survival game with cute graphics and i fell in love the moment i first tried the game.  Moreover it is quite easy to play it with friends! You can host your game for free and ask your friends to join or vice versa. Just make sure both of you have sufficient internet connection so all of you could play well and have fun. Or you could just join some dedicated server and meet some strangers out there!

It's definitely really, really fun to play with friends, and the mod support is excellent. however, finding your friends is extremely difficult...  summer is also a huge pain, and so is fire. certain items help prevent things but the method of acquisition (if you don't mess with the settings) is kind of very late game, despite seasons coming and going quickly.T here are certain methods that make restoring things, but there's just so much going on, it feels like a clutter of things.

And oh boy, it was - and still is - one of the most special and interesting, as well as fun and challenging multiplayer games for me to play, even tho I mostly played in co-op.  The game doesn't differ much from the original ""Don't Starve"" except it's on multiplayer mode, featuring the possibilities of surviving in a small group - with or against other players... This means it's the same survival background and the same game mechanics, which is great since ""Don't Starve"" already features loads of great content and pretty much offers you a great singleplayer which you now can enjoy with many of your friends or strangers! Surviving in the mysterious and dark world of ""Don't Starve"", hunting down monsters from the ""Reign of Giants""-DLC and (probably soon) exploring the beautiful iles of the ""Shipwrecked""-DLC is a challenge in the original game, and it still is in the multiplayer - but it doesn't feel as lonely, and for me (peronally) it's one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had!  Thus I strongly recommend you to buy this game if you like the singleplayer or if you're interested in survival games with a multiplayer in general! If you have neither the single- nor the multiplayer you should check out the ""Don't Starve MEGA PACK"" - it's really worth the money, especially if it's on sale!

76561198074644085,"This game receives a lot of credit from the start of my review for being so incredibly unique. Allow me to begin with a brief yet relevant tangent: the ever-growing community of gamers in today's technologically advanced society has brought about more and more games being produced with each passing day. And as great as that is, a lot of these games have begun to look the same. Call of Duty, Battlefront, Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, they all satisfy the exact same prerequisites to create a wartime, pro-America, FPS videogame, and they all appeal to the exact same audience. I'm not saying these are bad games by any means; as a matter of fact they are each highly successful franchises in their own regard. All I'm saying is that they're all too similar to one another. After playing just one, I get the point. Shoot the bad guys, dont let them shoot you. There's nothing noticeable enough to distinguish them from their competitors, but the demand for such games is large enough that they can share the market.  Now back to the review: Don't Starve is NOT one of these games. And that's why I love it so much. It almost categorizes itself into its own genre, and I applaud that endlessly in this day and age. The permadeath feature of the game is frustrating to the novice gamer for obvious reasons, but there are in-game settings to adjust the penalty for dying. The gameplay itself is exhilerating, especially when coordinating strategies among friends (although if you're anything like my friends you'll spend hours screaming at each other over Skype), but that's all part of the fun. The world is vast, and there are lots of areas to explore, enemies to kill, and loot to find and craft. The goal is blatantly simple, but the means of completing the goal are devastatingly complex.   All in all it's a great game at a great price, and it's often times on sale (I bought it for $10).  Two thumbs up!",1451442621,True

Pros Fresh gameplay experience/style Encourages exploration instead of camping down on one spot for too long This game has an ending if you want to beat the game but you can always build a home. Has a lot of unique elements and playstyles of the game.

As in, you have to find more food, more materials for tools, armor, etc. It is especially hard with multiple people when it comes winter time.    (I find it troubling because of the scarce food supply, and crops not growing because they're frozen over.)  But I do just love playing alongside my friends, and beating monsters that would otherwise be challenging. The downside is that every few minutes, I get disconnected. I'm not sure if it's a bug, or if it's my friend's internet (he hosts). Also, when someone leaves, it still counts them in when the hounds come. Like, if you have your server set to 4 players, and they all join, then 2 leave, it still sends (x) amount of hounds as if the whole 4 players were in the game.

I like it because there's no major plot or objective to it, than simply -don't die. There are numerous ways your time could be cut short. And your only task is to overcome it. Build, create, struggle, and if you're doing it good enough, thrive.  There are however numerous ways the co-op aspects of the game can be ruined to the point of aggravation. The greatest reason for this is because it is vulnerable to ""griefers"" who destroys everything you've built up (hence why I only play with trusted people, sadly). Another thing being the lack of options for ressurrection early on, in case one of you happens to die. In contrast to the single player version of the game, where you can just restart.

76561198003156862,"I bought the Frontier pack for EUR9,99 during a Steam sale and I'm not fully convinced the game is worth this much. I have had fun playing it, the plus sides are:   - Well-working multiplayer (at least I've had zero problems), the server remembers where you left off, easy-to-create servers etc  -Exquisite graphic & sound design with a very distinguished artistic approach. Many people say it's like Tim Burton, but I'm most reminded of a cardgame called Gloom  - Pleasant sound FX  What I do not like:  - The Minimap. I'm guessing it's an early access thing (or maybe not?), but I would like to see where my partner is. I mean, if it's meant to ""make the game more challenging"", it's failing, because we oriented with the Portal (e.g I'm 9 squares south-west of the portal), but it's just tedious and boring. Why not add the other players on the minimap?  - The Minimap - progress. I hate the fact that I'm losing progress when I die. I mean, my character still knows the surroundings, I became a ghost and then was resurrected, right? So how do you justify me losing my memory? Again, it's just tedious.  - The scarcity of resource in some areas. Okay, so I get that it's a survival game and you're supposed to feel ""tense"", but it's a completely different thing if me and my friend spend one entire day looking for ANYTHING edible and we find one berry bush. One playthrough, we went 5 days never meeting a carrot/berries. If you dont have carrots, you cant kill bunnies either with your trap... It's just that sometimes, it became superboring to go through a similar empty landscape. There are so many interesting choices to be made - e.g make a toxic mushroom field, where you have mushrooms that do relieve your hunger, BUT drain sanity or something like that. The tensity disappears quite soon if there is no resources available. Paired with the minimap issues, it becomes excessively annoying, because you need to go far away from each other to scout for resources, but finding each other again (unless your meeting point is the portal), will be very tedious.   Overall, I think it's an enjoyable filler game and probably fills the niche of ""what to play with your girlfriend"" so here's one couple-LAN-party game.

76561198090383305,"I found Don't Starve Together rather enjoyable, it's very fun, and very easy to play. Klei have done an amazing job coding the original Don't Starve into this multiplayer version and it's obvious that they've done a brilliant job doing so. The game itself consists of a 2D/3D background with a cartoonish grey outlook where your aim is to survive as long as possible until you die, depending on whether you have a friend on your game with you, there will or won't be a chance to respawn. If a friend is on with you then he/she can craft a ""Telltale heart"" to bring back a dead player at the cost of 20 health, 3 grass and a spider gland. Dead players cause sanity loss on living players and can roam around ""haunting"" objects and creatures. Perhaps later on as an idea for haunting, the dead player can control the object/animal depending on sanity and having low sanity can allow you to control bigger and more ""alive"" creatures/objects.  Don't Starve Together also brings the concepts from Reign of giants into the game, such as the actual ""giants"". These giants seem to be seasonal with ""bearger"" at autumn, ""Deerclops"" at winter, ""???"" (or goose/moose) at spring and ""Dragonfly"" at summer. These Giant enemies bring a new challenge to players and can bring games to an end because of the high attack damage they possess. This can be a rather difficult challenge for players as giants such as ""deerclops"" can come out of the darkness in winter and destroy your base/encampment.    Don't Starve Together also brings new characters and character concepts into the game, such as ""Wigfrid"" a warrior woman who can only eat meat and has her own character locked weapon and armor called the ""Battle Spear"" and the ""Battle helm"", I found this very useful and fun to be able to use a new weapon which won't bring down sanity, however the character itself can be rather restrictive as when I played as ""Wigfrid"" I felt as if I were restricted to my base as I could not wander too far from my food source which was rabbit traps. Perhaps ""Wigfrid"" could eat food and it would be more filling so that it makes up for the fact that if there is was little meat left the character won't die so fast of hunger and allow for players such as myself to be able to explore without too many restrictions.   ""Webber"" is another addition to the game and is described as (""Is a monster, befriends spiders, grows a silky beard"") he is a very good addition to the game and grants a bigger freedom in the game as the character can eat a wider variety of foods such as monster meat, which I found as a brilliant idea for a character. The character itself though get's attacked by ""Pigs"" if the character gets in a close proximity and this can be very repetitive and persistent, this is a good idea at best but perhaps the character ""webber"" could just be unable to befriend ""Pigs"" and just instead of being attacked just avoided.  Overall I found the game very enjoyable and would be happy to see any improvements in the game such as previously stated and caves which I'm sure Klei are working hard on.",1446984505,True

76561198332529760,"The epitome of Chaos  Day 1: My friends and I coup at spawn, and rummage our surroundings for resource. Kooper begins as WX-78, he's quite new to the game. Jacob goes for Webster, he's new as well, but knows that guides exist. I go for Willow, I'm the most experienced player of us all.  Day 3: After my friends nearly starve and I've gained 31 gold, we rendezvous at the Florid Postern to scour the darkness with a camp fire, followed by a science and alchemy machine. Numerous threats are administered between my friends as I plan for what's to come  Day 6: I successfully implement 2 farms into our settlement, and a bee box follows a few minutes later. It's not much, but it's a minor amount of regenerable food.  Day 12: We're beginning to have food issues. 3 mouths isn't easy to feed with such a small area to rummage around, especially with such a slow revitalization rate that the plants have. To make it worse, Glen, another friend, joins the server. He plays as Wendy.  Day 13: At dusk, we hear them. The hounds. They're dead, and I'm left with 13 health. Just before the cloak of night, 3 claps of thunder can be heard in the distance as they revive at a touch stone.  Day 16: Jacob is having lots of trouble with maintaining his sanity. Numerous times he has hit single digits, and nearly ended this escapade if I hadn't had Bernie.  Day 19: We're all starving, and the long nights that keep us stuck around the campfires isn't certainly helping. Winter is on the horizon, and we're not prepared what so ever.   Day 21: The first morning of winter, the snowbirds appear. Things head south, we're freezing, and Willow's inability to stay in the cold is certainly crippling my abilities.   Day 23: We've run bankrupt, there's nothing left. Then the thought hits me as my friends fight for the last monster lasagna cooking in the crock pot, the caves. They're our only hope.  Day 24: Our sanity is barely anything. I'm on the brink of 20, and the rest have single digits. Jacob has officially reached 0 sanity. We make our run to the nearest clogged sinkhole, I have to stay back to keep myself warm with a forest fire from my lighter.  Day 26: We've set up camp in the caves, and things aren't going well. Jacob, as Webster, is exiled by the nearby pack of rabbit men, and has to live in isolation. He dies mere minutes later as darkness envelopes him and his base. There isn't any hope of revival, with no touch stones or spider glands to use, he's done until we reach spring.  Day 29: They're all dead, they starved. It's only me. I shouldn't have eaten that lightbulb, should I?  Day 30: Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. 0 sanity. My days are numbered.  Day 34: I make a stance with only 2 days left until I can return to the surface. I'm so close, I just have to keep this up for 2 more days.  Day 35: I try to regain sanity, staying as close to the fire as possible with my rotting garland onto of my head. Bernie fends off the darkness as the spiders crusade upon the rabbits that provide my second sense of defense.  Day 36: I'm free, It's time. Winter is over. At least, I think it is.  I make my way to the surface. Bad decision. A group of snowy hounds have been waiting vigilantly at the gates to the surface. Turns out day 36 was the last day of winter, not the first day of spring.  I die, I have no defense, no sanity, and no direction of where to go beyond this point.  We lasted 36 days.

Its visuals, its music, its characters - all of it pops out in such beautiful charm, and the gameplay has such a simplistic style that it makes you invest in it, and the more you invest, the more you discover and thrive as a player. You are going to die. A lot. Whether it be to starving, to the darkness, to your own insanity, or even to spiders. Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand. But you get better, you learn from your mistakes, and you overcome your weaknesses.   I rarely play online with strangers, but with a group of friends, it is a blast. Huddling together at night, working hard during the day, using your character's strengths to work with those of others, it's so much fun. You build and build until you realise that you're all, in a funny way, a family. A bunch of people stranded and who must work together.   Get this game.

I need a few more hours played to be absolutely sure, but I think after a little over 3000 hours under my belt that I have figured out, mostly, how not to starve! Klei Entertainment is hands down the best company making games.  They hardly ever disappoint their audience, and if you don't like something, and you tell them about it politely, you'll get a reply explaining things. There are a lot of survival games nowadays, but DST is unique. There is no manual, it is a sink or swim game. And you die at first, over and over again. But there is something about being afraid of the dark that they tapped into. When you first start playing you fear nightfall because in DST, as in it's predecessor Don't Starve, there really ARE things out there that will kill you when night falls. Of course, other things are happily trying to kill you in the daylight, too. There is a lot of fun in the game, and Klei's programmers have a wicked sense of humour and a love of punning! This game has got better and better over the years. Since December of 2014 the Don't Starve universe has consumed a huge amount of my time and I still play one or other version every day. And I still die! But not of starvation.  Edited Nov 26th 2019. After another 450 hours or so, I have to say that I finally learned how to die infrequently. And that I really like this game.

Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.  As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.   If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.  Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently.

76561198090104888,"Don't Starve Together is a game that I can say quite a lot about even as someone who hasn't played the original Don't Starve. If you are wanting to buy this game, but you intend to only play it by yourself, then I strongly suggest you stop now, don't get this game, and get the original Don't Starve along with its DLCs instead. If you still want to get this game, then I'm just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you'll need to know stuff about the original Don't Starve as well.   You don't need to know the plot of the original game to know what Don't Starve is about. Even though it is a sequel in a way, you don't need to know what happened. Basically, you're going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal, survive as long as you can. There is a lore to the game, and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it's really interesting and ever so more expanding. The world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do, but it's that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it.   Right off the bat, the game spews charm from it. From character and monster designs, to the artstyle, the old vintage look, and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have. I can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme.   You'll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you'll play as, each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other. For players who have already played Don't Starve, you won't have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked, they're all unlocked right out of the gate. Also for players who have played Don't Starve, the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer. Each character fits a different play style so you'll never feel as though you're playing as the same character, and you can feel the differences with each character and you'll find someone with a playstyle who you'll enjoy playing as the most.  This game is not easy and if you are new, you'll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do. The game is not going to teach you anything, you'll either have to learn to survive as you play, learn from other players, or research about the game. At no point are you ever going to be safe. You'll have to eat to keep yourself from starving, find ways to restore your character's sanity so that way you don't go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures, fire can spread and destroy precious resources, some resources can't respawn, some creatures will attack and try to kill you, and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day. Even changing seasons will be a hazard as you'll either have to survive the cold of winter, the storms of spring, or the heat of summer. It may be hard to get into first, but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays, it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to. You'll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you'll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long.  The one thing that stands about this game over the original Don't Starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people. You can play by yourself, but it won't be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the Steam Workshop. If you're going to play this game with others, I highly recommend playing with friends.   If there is one thing I can say about this game is that it will get reptitive. Once you get the hang of the game, it's just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it, you'll have nearly nothing to worry about.   If you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends, this game is definitely for you and I can highly recommend it to others. Even though it can get repetitive after a while, I still find it to be a fun game where you'll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going, and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it, I can see it being supported for a long time.",1509856904,True

Honestly, the level of dedication the developers have to churning out new content FOR FREE* almost every other month is astounding, especially considering the game has been out since 2016.  Now, to gameplay itself. You will die, a lot, and you'll enjoy it. This game has enough depth to keep you interested for months, and depending on the amount of people you're surviving with, this dynamic will also be different each time. Different character combinations will shift your survival focus to different things.  Also, it's not just a sandbox where you survive to explore a procedurally generated world -- there are certain events to complete, bosses to beat and set pieces to make function and take advantage of, all of them require planning and numerous attempts.   Again, you will die a lot, but preparing for it is a challenge in itself. Building a self-sustaining base with your friends is fun, figuring out ways to beat bosses and survive seasons is fun (I advise you to hold off Youtube and wikis for a while and take pleasure in working out game mechanics yourself).  All in all, this game is a gift that keeps on giving. I strongly recommend the game for all seeking either a casual experience with your friends, or a challenging survival sandbox that has both style and depth to keep you entertained for months.   *bar 2 out of 15 characters, one of which you get for free if you own the Hamlet DLC for the original game.

76561198194237109,"I am just a new player. So far too good 11/10. This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...  If you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).  Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.

76561198290310711,"[b]**NOTE: This review will be constantly updated to accomadate any changes in my opinion, updates, etc.**[/b]   [h1]INTRODUCTION[/h1]  I heard a lot of good stuff about Don't Starve Together, and I've watched some of my favorite YouTubers play the game. That's probably what drove me to buy it. My friend also happened to have Don't Starve Together, so we could play together. The game definitely isn't as much fun without friends, lemme tell ya.  So the game was fifteen dollars. It seemed like a pretty decent price, and I thought, ""well, why the heck not?"" So, to checkout I go. I had HIGH expectations, and I was worried that since I kind of knew about the game already, I would miss out on the experience of exploring it myself.  Haha... I'm laughing because I was an idiot.   [h1]WHAT DON'T STARVE TOGETHER IS[/h1]  Don't Starve Together has the amazing features of Don't Starve, except it's multiplayer and there's a different story. The art is dauntingly adorable. What do I mean by that? The art sets you into a world about survival and its dangers. I seriously love it. The type of art compliments the gameplay style perfectly, and it makes the game [i]that[/i] much more enjoyable.  You're thrown into an unforgiving world. There are tons of monsters, darkness that will swallow you whole, and lands that will try to kill you. But along with this sparks fascination. You have to survive in a crude world, learning along the way, picking up tips & tricks, and gathering tons of knowledge.  This is definitely my favorite survival game. It has greath depth, it's compelling, and extremely creative. The crafting aspect is fun, and exploring things is just simply enchanting.  The [b]purpose of Don't Starve Together[/b] is to play with friends, and I definitely recommend so. It's much more fun if you play with other people.  I usually recommend buying Don't Starve Together instead of Don't Starve, because in DST (Don't Starve Together) you can play both singleplayer and multiplayer. The only difference is the story. DST's story is a continuation of the original and classic Don't Starve. But honestly, the story isn't as important in my opinion, as the game can be a total sandbox and is much more valuable because it has multiplayer. It's meant more to be a sandbox type game, but the story can be important (it depends on the player).  If you're someone who doesn't play mutliplayer, then get Don't Starve. Otherwise I recommend Don't Starve Together. Even then, there are public servers you can join and play with other strangers.... totally trustworthy.  [h1]PLAYING[/h1]  I really, [i]really[/i] love this game. So far, I've played 130 hours in total. I wasted a lot of time. ([i]A lot[/i]). There's a lot to explore, and with 130 hours... I honestly haven't gotten into half the game yet! I know. I should've by now. But there's a seriously fun aspect with Don't Starve Together that won't let you drop it, and I'm surprised I haven't written this review sooner.  The great part is, there are tons of different mods created by the community that can impact your game. You should really get them. They're awesome, and yes, trustworthy. They're located in the workshop (in case you're wondering). And they seriously make your game much more fun. If you ever get the game and want to know what mods I recommend, please message in the comments below. There are lot of different mods, but there are some extremely important ones that make your game easier and more immersive.  Exploring was so much fun. The whole aspect reminds me of Stardew Valley, but to me there are a lot more things to discover in Don't Starve Together, and with friends it's amazing. You really shouldn't underestimate the game. It has a lot to offer, and is popular for a fantastic reason: it's purely great.  [i]""It's definitely a better game with friends. And it can be spooky & scary, especially if you don't know what's going on (rlly now?). I swear if you write this word for word-""[/i] - Quote from Kuep.   ^^^ He read it. [i]""You're a spaghetti-o-""[/i], he says.  Don't Starve Together is very unique, comedic, and fun overall. Much recommendation. I had a lot of moments where I died laughing, a lot of ""WTF"" moments, and honestly the game is a great excuse to have a good time with your friends. So if you wanna trick people into liking you, play this with them.  [h1]THE PROS[/h1]  - Adorable art. It fits the game perfectly, and you will love it's cuteness.  - Fun characters. Each default character has a backstory and unique personalities and weapons.  - Mods. Mods made by the community that makes your game extremely fun. You will love your life once you get them. Seriously.  - Exploration. Lots o' exploration. Lots o' fun. Enuff said.  - Challenge. The game offers challenges to those who like it, and even with normal gameplay you have to survive hunger and sanity. You can customize your settings to what you want on Don't Starve Together, and I really think that's fantastic.  - Uniqueness. It may have the classic but fun ""survive"" theme, but it has unique gameplay (you'll see what I mean if you buy it. Which you should.)  - Constantly updated. Constantly updated with new and old things from Don't Starve, and that's great. Games that don't update sometimes get boring, but with an alive workshop community and constant updates, that sure won't happen soon.  - Music. It's daunting. It's revving. It's themed perfectly. What more could you ask for?   [h1]THE CONS[/h1]  - Connection issues. Sometimes even though your wifi works on both ends servers get a little laggy, but it doesn't happen that much. Watch out if the person hosting the server has terrible wifi. You will hate them and your life.  - Imcompatible mods. This is not really a con, but it IS something you should be aware of. There are mods in the workshop that won't work with each other, and sometimes they will crash your game. This is annoying because if you subscribe to a lot of mods you have to go through each one to see which is crashing your game. For the most part, most mods are working fine. It's more of the, ""ehhhh""-looking mods that don't work, (which is kind of obvious).  - Sometimes crashes. Sometimes Don't Starve Together has file issues and crashes your game. It happens rarely, but it is something to watch out for. No, none of these crashes deleted any of my progress, which is excellent. The game autosaves quite frequently. (Now that I think about it I've never had to save myself... Wait is there even a manual save button???)   [h1]PLACES TO IMPROVE[/h1]  - Crashes. Please fix file issues that occur randomly. A lot of users do have this, but as I said, it doesn't wipe any progress whatsoever.  - New biomes. I would love if there were new biomes. Something fascinating.  - New items. I would like new items. Once you play the game you realize there isn't that much diversity, but that's where mods come in! Hah. Still please make new items. <3   [h1]DON'T STARVE YOURSELF HESITATING TO BUY THE GAME (I'm bloody hilarious)[/h1]  It's fun as hell, and I had a lot of fun with this game. It is a game where you have to constantly look out for not dying, but there's [i]so[/i] much fun being chased to death by hounds. Trust me. It's a first-time experience. (I don't know if it is for you, though... o_o). And the fact that everyone is screaming that there's a gigantic black flea trying to chomp you (aka, the hounds) makes it all-the-while.  I want to stress about the art, because it really does fit well. I think it's perfectly suitable for the game, and it's extremely likeable as well.  This is a game I definitely recommend. A lot of fun, with challenges, and the great survival aspect I love. It's very original, and the characters are extremely comedic. The game can even be relaxing if you choose for it to be, or it can be freaking death chasing after you every split-second of your existence.

76561198043774270,"Excellent survival game with a unique artstyle and consistenty strange personality. One of the few actually complete survival games, with tons of stuff to discover and run away from!   In this online co op version of the original game, not only do you get to play with friends, but you also get the reign of giants dlc for free! I'm a bit perplexed as to why the original game doesn't have this content as well yet though (included).  In don't starve you do exactly what the title suggests. find food. Food is essentially the most important thing in the game, being the sole reason to venture out and gather things. If you don't keep finding food, you eventually starve. There are plenty of other dangers of course, but ultimately, it's that constant need for food that really makes it a challenge. Wolves? No problem. Giant dragon flies? Peice of cake. Carrots? SHIT WE RAN OUT OF CARROTS.   This game is so much more fun with other people. Sure, it was fun alone, but the dynamics of co op really make it extra fun. Your friend might accidentally provoke an army of pigs to murder them, then you have to go rescue them and you then spend 10 days trying to recover the health and sanity you lost, ultimately crippling your preperation for winter. THAT is the sort of wonderful stuff that can enrich your experience. And obviously, friends aren't always a burden. YOU might be the burden at some point and they get to rescue you. Or you can all share food with eachother. It's just really really fun.   Definitely recommend this game.

I liked the earlier game but I always found it too stressful.

76561197967159739,"This is a fun co-op survival game, though game mechanics discourage larger servers.   Dead players bring the 'sanity' of live players down, so on large servers (which are more likely to have a dead player at any given moment), your 'sanity' is threatened more often. Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers.   Communication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.  On top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.  All of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge.",1418766878,True

However, the lag can be fixed with a simple restart of the server which takes like 2 minutes max -This isn't really a con, I just dont understand it?

They are not nearly as brutal as the original game, by merit of having help.  It's still a grueling survival game, but on larger games it can get quite well established, to the point where most threats aren't even a concern.  The ghost mechanic is also a little annoying for when you're playing the game socially, and mostly want to just enjoy time with friends, since the optimal course of action for someone who is in ghost form, who can't immediately be ressurected, is to log out of the server.

Luckily that is not the case because basically anything might kill you if you don't watch out! Various beasts, catastrophes, shadow figures or feeble-minded pigs might cross your way and won't make it easy for you to stay alive in this rough world. So why not invite some friends? The title says it all, other than the Singleplayer: ""Don't Starve"" here you should probably bring some company to explore the world and exist against those horrible creatures. But if it wasn't difficult enough.. the weather won't be on your side for long either. It might be rather challenging to play this Game and there are a lot of mechanics and tricks that make DST unique, but you will need quite some experience to figure them out. The very charming graphics and humor will make you love the Game quicker than you want.[/i]  [u]Characters:[/u] You can select from a lot of different characters for your journey, who all have their very personal Pros & Cons. The specific abilities and weaknesses make the gameplay exciting and miscellaneous everytime again, trust me.. From Robots and Spiders to Scientists and Warrior Valkyries your choice is kind of unlimited (even more and better characters are still developed) and up to you and your fellow survivors.  [u]Base Building:[/u] Of course you can wander around as a Nomad, gather ressources and be on track all the time but the essence to be progressive in DST is to build yourself a base for all your needs, I mean who wouldn't prefer some delicious Meatballs fresh from the crockpot over berries and carrots.. In order to set up your buildings you can't just immediately cobble together some boards and stones like a pig.. You have to invent them before! By the huge variety of items in the Game it won't be easy to obtain them all. So good luck.  [u]Boss Creatures:[/u] Every now and then some more or less scary Meanies will come to destroy your well deserved progress! Better be prepared and packed with armor, weapons and perhaps some magical items to defeat them. *Psst* They also have unique loot which will grant you access to craft cool gadgets or equipments to make your living easier :)  [u]The Caves:[/u] On the one hand there's the actually quite harmless overworld with its rich land but on the other there's also the underground which has a lot of dangerous and scary beasts lurking for you in the darkness! But if you can prevail down there, you will probably be abled to find the magical secrets of the ruins, which should be discovered by yourself. Once you have beaten them you can rule the overworld with your knowledge!  [h1]Skins (and how to get them)[/h1] Yes, here you'll also find those Skins for Items you might already know from other Games ^^ Don't worry.. they're just cosmetic and won't give you any advantage! Besides the advantage of spicy looking characters, tools or buildings. And you can even share the skins on tools or buildings with your friends in-game, so everyone profits from them ;)  You get 1 Skin Drop everyday by logging in and 8 Skin Drops every week by playing (Caution! Science required) Some might be marketable and some might not be, but they look cool non the less :D You can also purchase Skin Collections in the Shop of the Game to support the Developers!

Be warned though, once you boot up this game, you may never see your family or sunlight ever again.

It's a very helpful mod that acts as a visual HUD for the console.) ------------------------- Here's a list of things you could try doing: You could try your hand at taming beefalo. You could try taking out some of the Giants. You could gather supplies for those who need it. You could explore the caves. You could raid the ruins. You could traverse the Labyrinth. You could kill the Ancient Guardian. You could battle the Marble Chess pieces on a full moon. You could then battle the Shadow Chess Pieces on the new moon. You could then gather 8 fossil fragments and assemble them in the atrium. You could then fight the Ancient Fuelweaver. After that you could go fight Toadstool.

76561198052179245,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason.   If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed.   Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!

76561198101060738,"Don't Starve Together is a top-down survival game of the original Don't Starve, now with multiple mouths to feed with.   You start off by selecting one of the diverse characters from the Wilson Family and are thrown right into the world. Your job is, as the title suggests, to don't starve and survive the upcoming 4 seasonal periods. As from there it goes on, you craft science machines to invent new things, get clothing to fit into the current circumstances and fight off hundreds of hounds, spiders and giants along your way. If you die, there's no other way to be resurrected except a few rare items or the all-famous Telltale Heart, crafted with the blood of other players (literally).  Pros: This game is harsh. It is full of little things that try to kill you or the other way around, limited resources are almost guaranteed, and let's not forget the seasons. You have to prepare for the upcoming season you are about in to enter, which can be a bit tricky sometimes to get used to. Clothing, Hats or items that help you stay cool, warm and dry are crucial.   The gathering of resources and understanding the core on what to do to survive is satisfying to watch. Having your own base set up with all required farms, chests and structures gives a successful feeling to the player and encourages them to repeat said process, to see if they really got the hangout.   Speaking of base building, this is a good game to play with a friend to that has a basic knowledge. A newcomer can learn fairly easily where the rabbit is going and should get the hang of the survival techniques quickly. It may be confusing on what to do first, so it is always recommended to watch what others do, hence said before that it is good to play it with another friend with basic information.   Immense workshop support. This is a big plus for all the mods out there. They can make your life easier, harder or just add some neat little things that really don't change the core too much but help out a ton.   Cons: The lore of this world you are in is briefly explained as ""statues that stand around"". There is no real way to tell how much the game developed in the story without looking it up online. I wished the lore would be given to you at least a bit while playing.   While the world is easy to jump into, the resource placement can be pretty shady at certain parts. I once had one world where thousands of lizards spawned in the middle of the desert, or one biome wasn't generated at all, even after exploring the entire map for a good solid 10 days.   Seasonal periods last for a long time and aren't something you would play quickly for an hr and then go shut the game off. To get into winter, at least 20 days are set, which are about 2 hours in. It doesn't seem that much but the time can feel stretched out at this point.

Main reason : lots of necessary resources are not reproduceable. For instance, flints and stones in early versions. When you get in the serve afterwards, it's almost impossible to play it.  很多一次性资源烧了就烧了，一个Griefer进来整个服全废了，杀牛烧基地烧猪人村的啥都见过 Once a griefer come in the serve, the serve would face a massive catastrophe. He would burn the big houses, the base, kill the buffalos and dig rabbit holes, burn everyone elses' hard work into ashes easily.  新人在冬天或者夏天进服基本必死。然后新手一死，survival服务器马上就炸了，我理解一个人死降所有人san值是为了让大家有羁绊，但是很多新人一进服到处乱转，死了也不说话，所有人都找不到他，大家san值一起疯狂的掉，这使得很多吃san值的角色根本没法用（机器人，图书管理员） If you come in the serve in winter/summer, you are a dead wilson. Once a player dead it would not be a good situation for anyone else in the survival serves. I know the aim of sanity loss for death is to tied up all the members, but there always be someone likes to play alone and once he/she's dead, no one could find him and would suffer a long time.(Usually I quit in this circumstances.) It also cause many characters who have got low sanity rarely seen in the serve, like WX78 and librarian.  这造成服务器的新人友好度低，因为新人很大程度上基本上和破坏者Griefer没什么差别. At last most serves are not welcome the new players and give them little help, cuz unexperienced new players have small differences with griefers.  我很喜欢这游戏，希望能在多人服务器的可持续性上多一些改进。这样才能“一起繁荣”. I love this game very much and I hope in the near future the game would improve in sustainable issues in order to Thrive Together.  ",1458387770,True

76561198055278545,"You kick your feet up peacefully. The roaring fire glistens in your eyeballs, and a warmth encompasses you. Not only physically, but mentally. You've made it through the hard part, after all- right? Those silly spiders and frogs couldn't keep you down! Then you hear it, feintly echoing over the empty plains: barking. ""What's that?"" you think, worrying. You've faced wolves before, killed them even. But these seem...different. As you reach for the spear to your side, you hear the beating footsteps of the pack, drumming their way up towards the light. You tighten your grip around the spear- you are prepared.  Except you really weren't! Dogs jump from all angles towards you, salivating, hungering, desperate for a bite. You slash and spin, killing a few as you go. But...there's a different one. A red one! It runs over, and in a second, one single moment, everything is set ablaze. You watch as your chests, farms, machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time. In your shock and awe, the red dog takes you in his jaws, ferrying you into the darkness. Your body, being devoured, simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash.  ================== A new day... a new chance?  You push through the first 29 days in this hell. You've made quite the home for yourself! And look at that! Not even the fire-dogs could stop you now! ""Another victory!"" you yell, as your friends lift their meatballs in the air for you all. You revel in the moonlight, basking in the greatness that you're all responsible for. A bird cage? Farms? Bushes? Fridges?? You're advanced now! You're self-sufficient! Proud survivors! Everything is brilliant! Not even the biting cold of winter can stomp the burning passion you're all feeling.  But then, as you sit to enjoy a moments peace, the serenity is disturbed. A tremor. A single shake in the ground, followed by a monstrous roar. The team pause, confused. Suddenly, before you know it, another is unleashed. You all look to eachother for answers, but no answers can help now. In the corner of your eye, you see it. Reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire, there is an iris, floating high above the ground. Another tremor rattles the team, and the body of the creature is exposed. A single eye, antlers, a fur coat, and the will to destroy. Time slows down.  You observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature, as it swipes the ground, eviscerating them. Your friends fall to the floor, lascerated with gaping wounds. Blood shoots from their oozing injuries, and the creature laughs, turning its attention to your happiness, your creation. It stomps on the bird cages, uproots the farms, and defecates on your berry bushes, before crushing them inbetween its hand. As the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers, it's eyeball finds its way to you. It stares at you, dropping the pooey bushes. You close your eyes, drop your clothing, and assume the necessary position for what is to follow.  You don't quite survive that winter.  ",1446512789,True

76561198103591851,"Don't starve together Review. Intro Don't starve together is a online game of don't starve written in LUA code developed by klei entertainment. As I have spent well over 580 hours playing the game, hosting dedicated servers, making mods, playing though-out early access and after release I will tell you what I think of the game that ate up most of my free time.  Pros 1 The game is stable, functional and works well just like don't starve does but only online. The game has a massively active fanbase and after I wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages I have been sent to help people on their server, to help get mods working and to join people in there server. The game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag, but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well. I have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me, running 20-40 mods with many people on a server.   2 The game is modable it runs on  the same code as don't starve on LUA code so if you know how to read basic code, and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game. I have been able to make mods for don't starve and don't starve together although I only published them privately. The game is very easy to mod, hell even someone as shit at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made, crappy, interesting, fun and awful mods you can enjoy. You could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore, or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the don't starve together workshop has.   3 The game is really fun I don't need to say that when I spent over 580 hours in the game do I? Well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content. The combat in the game I would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright. Cons  1  The game made me read and write code. I didn't need to and I didn't want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so I could log out of my own game then rejoin it when I came back. Then I learned stuff like how to write ini files, LUA, batch files, and other codey words I can't remember. That stuff isn't fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game. If you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff.    2 The game doesn't have local multiplayer its possible I even say a don't starve mod have local multiplayer so why didn't they add that into DST? Well I can think of why they didn't they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and that's fine. It still sucks that I can't play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever.  WARNING this game is going to mess with you, first you join a few games then your like ""oh I liked this in this game but I didn't like this in, this game"" then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse. Second, You will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 30-80 mods you can enable or disable in your game. then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods, then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer, then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast, well and you will build a awesome base with other players, have lots of fun but then because PVP is off and the game is public, the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made. You can't kick the scum fast enough and you don't just want to kick them... No you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it. So then you turn PVP on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you. Then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies. Warning this game will change you.   Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, yeah its alright. ",1475628379,True

First at all, It's an open world game.In the game the protaganist is trapped in an island, you must explore,collect things,learn,fight, and craft to survive there.But how to survive depends on player's choices.So this island is a mini world.You'll do all things there by your will and choices.That's what attracts me most.I like this kind of games,such as Mount&Blade which I have played for 5 years.  Don't starve's art style is also awesome which will make you remember of Tim Burton's movies.and I really love its adorable character design.  It will be challenging at beginning.You will die for many times for many kinds of reasons.You will learn things from every failure.until you've learned enough skills to survive for really long time, you won't feel hungry any more,but you will feel lonely.as you are the only person in that world(only in Don't Starve). ---------------------------------------------------------------- and good thing is,you won't feel lonely anymore,you can play with your friends now.You need to divide the work and cooperate.That may be more interesting than working alone. You can also make new friends by this game.I met a friendly Korean kid.She(He?) played really well and  helped me generously.We talked by translation software.But I can't play with her anymore because of the bad network.",1506506170,True
76561198255074025,"Stunning art style and unique gameplay. I never like playing survival game because I'm not very good at surviving but this one is different.   This game is just like any other survival games, throwing the player into a world without any instructions but I felt that every deaths is a learning curve that the players learned as they go unlike other games dying from the same thing and never learn anything. Plus not most survival games are third person orientated.   Just like other games, this game also really push you to your limits such as testing your ability, skill, resource spending and time management. You will need to be strategic when you're playing in a harsh world this game puts you in. Planning ahead and praticing in game combat skills if you're one of those hardcore players. Oh yea, there is also PvP for those sociopathy people who killed people for fun.   If you're like me who prefer calm and relaxing gameplay you could play on endless where you are not punished too hard if you died but still keeping survival game vibe.  In the end, I would recommend if you like strategy games, this one would be the one for you. Just before you play I would highly suggest that you go watch some videos and reading wiki before you start playing unless you're like me, entering a gunfight with a knife.",1501344101,True

76561198417658365,"Famine is one of the few games that makes me scratch my head. It provides many wonderful scenes of death, but to see these unforgettable moments, you need to spend a considerable amount of time each time working hard. In this game, you can spend hours collecting resources, equipping characters, fortifying bases, and ultimately just seeing your little paradise destroyed by an unstoppable group of shadow monsters. The game itself is to explore the risk of survival type, death is inevitable, and when you die, the game is really over. Famine doesn't treat players tenderly, which is the reason why I love and hate it.Klei studio adopted the production concept of My World, throwing players into the magnificent wilderness, how to survive is the player's own to understand. Some adventure gamers like this kind of white paper freedom very much. They can play a day with their patience, creativity and courage. But the lack of any guidance and mission goals in this work will allow you to find ways to survive in the world of Tim Burton's film style, and the Gothic style of painting will make you feel that your life is at stake. Simple stories, novel menus, children's literature atmosphere give people a very strange feeling, but the background music is very happy, and repeated brainwashing, soon let the author have to turn off the game music, play the music list of horrible weird atmosphere.The rules of the game are simple: explore the world, collect materials during the day, light a fire at night, eat, repeat. Although this routine has begun to be a bit vulgar, the hopeless struggle for survival brought about by the game is very strong. In a game process, the author found that the food was almost eaten, and was chased by a group of spiders running in the woods, the author felt that there was no hope, so he broke the kettle and sank the boat, facing the wind, set a tree on fire, soon, the whole forest was on fire, the spiders chasing me were also baked into silk, and then I used it. These silks make a dress.After a while, my character was exhausted and I lost my sense, when I was weak and let a little frog attack me, and eventually died under the frog's mouth. I died peacefully - I could have made some high-tech weapons, but I had lived enough to stay in the world of Famine. No achievements, no scores, only their own stories. Game experience is a reward for players.There are often unfair deaths in the game. There have been several times when the straw was in front of me, but in the end it was not available. Although the side view fully demonstrates the excellent artistic concepts of the game, it often blockades the key items painfully. The characteristic of the forest is that there are many trees here, but often encounter the angle of egg pain. You can never find something hidden behind the tree. When your life value is very low and you are chased by all kinds of creatures, a tree often decides your life and death. After death, it's at least another 30 minutes.The only way to break this cycle of life and death is through the doors scattered around the world, which can deliver you to small adventure missions. Usually the task is to have you look for something with a stick, and a group of monsters will try to eat you. These small tasks complement the plot, but once completed, the player returns to the crisis-ridden world, and still has no sense of accomplishment.Before I start a new game, I hesitate because the first 30 minutes or so of each new adventure are extremely boring and are absolutely repetitive and redundant. Indeed, every time I restart, I explore more recipes for making objects, or the behavioral characteristics of certain creatures, but my character not only loses all objects, but also all memories, and will not make advanced objects. I had to re-teach him all kinds of skills, which reminded me of Tetris, which had to endure a long start in order to experience the final frantic extreme escape.The beginning of Famine needs to be improved. You can add more random events, or multiplayer games, or different character skills. It's important to make death in Famine a loss of game progress, not a half-hour accumulation of boredom. Klei has promised to release large-scale updates within six months, and I am looking forward to their new content and hope that they can correct their existing problems.",1543551328,True

76561198154425534,"Don't Starve Together is one of those games where you can have fun no matter how many people because it itself, was originally a singleplayer experience. I have barely scratched the surface of the game, so take my review more as a ramble than an proper review, and while I could write most of this on the standard Don't Starve page, I've had more time on this game than standard DS.  First off, the art design. A lot of people say that the game's artstyle is very Tim Burton-esque, and I can wholeheartedly agree on that, but the inclusion of the Telltale heart item and many other things has also lead me to believe that this game and it's art direction was also inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, as the Tell Tale Heart was a story written by him, and Wilsons examination line ""The beating of this hideous heart will bring a ghost back to life!"" is a direct refrence to the story as well, giving me more proof that Poe's works of literature was a good inspiration to the game. I am a fan of the art style, it looks great, and that's all I really need to say.  Next up, the gameplay. which I am splitting up into two parts; the controls, and the general gameplay( characters and such). The controls feel nice, I prefer using keyboard and mouse instead of solely the keyboard or mouse, as both individually have their downsides. For the keyboard, using WASD is better than clicking, you can stop moving right when you need to, but the downside to the keyboard is when you try and do an action such as attacking or using the crafting menu, it's harder to control in my opinion, while the mouse handles both actions better. Despite all of that, I stil enjoy how it controls. But things such as attacking from a distance or force attacking can be a bit off at times. When I found a Varg at the end of a path, I tried to use a sleep dart on it, but instead of instantly shooting the dart, my character kept moving, to the point where I got the Varg aggroed onto me. There have also been countless times where I try to kill a Pigman or Batilisk near a sinkhole, but I keep breaking the walls around it down because force attack. But both of those are minor nitpicks and it doesn't matter in the long run, but to be honest hounds are just awful.  The characters are pretty well balanced, they each have their advantages and disadvantages, except for Wilson and Winona whom I both despise with no end. The two characters I mainly play as, Wendy and Maxwell, have good advantages, such as having Abigail or Shadow Puppets, but those advantages also have disadvantages, such as less damage dealt or being one of the most fragile characters in the game, which is why I hate characters such as Wilson or Winona, they have no real weaknesses, which makes them an easy pick for newers or less experienced players. Playing together is tons of fun if you and your teammates actually know what they're doing. I sometimes play with people I talk to regularly ([u] it would be really nice if my friends would actually respond to me on Discord but whatever.[/u]), or I just log onto public servers and try to survive without voice, but all-in-all, multiplayer is really fun.  [spoiler] But sometimes my connection to Klei's servers are so bad I get kicked from my own world [/spoiler]  And the last topic is price. This game is $14.99, which is also the price of standard Don't Starve, but one of the best part about the price is that you also get a free second copy of the game that you can send to friend, making this game a relative bargain for anyone who's on the fence about the game. It's even better, in my opinion, if you buy the Mega Pack, which saves you about the price of another copy of DST for everything related to Don't Starve except the soundtrack, which by the way, is pretty good. I've had a great time with the game so far, and it's been the only game I've played in the past few weeks, and I don't think that's going to change.  For a rating, I'll give it a 8.5/10, but if you want play Don't Starve Together without anyone, you could play DST by yourself, or you could just get the normal game, which costs more with RoG, but hey, you can also get Shipwrecked, and Hamlet is coming soon.

76561198072130676,"Don't Starve or Die Tryin’  Klei presents multiplayer spinoff of their “Don't Starve” franchise with everything you could expect: stylish artwork, abundance of weird fauna, frantic gameplay. If you are up to surviving simulators and have a few friends to join you on this quest - don’t bother reading further, just get Don't Starve Together instantly.   Most of issues I have with the game are rather personal and won’t be relevant if I could “git gud”. DST is really fast paced and keeps you from doing anything other than playing during whole session. So basically, I had to start with empty bladder and all the snacks and drinks beside me. Feels more like “Stay hydrated while playing”. This kind of approach is totally not my cup of tea. Also, game has some harsh start for beginners, because there is no any in-game tutorial, manual or anything to teach you basics - all is your tries-n-errors.   Art direction is what distinguishes DST from other survival sandboxes. Colorful and diverse world, with no “default” creatures or characters. Play more and you will see more “burtonesque” creations of game designers. Rich playable character roster gives you distinct experience in every playthrough, with char’s unique pros and cons.   What gives game a huge bonus - active modding community. Thanks to the workshop, you can customize your game in almost any way, or even make you game easier and friendlier to beginners: add minimap, display recipes and effects items have, or even “character pause” to have some break. Mechanically everything is quite simple and convenient to get right into playing: controls are intuitive, creating server is not harder than installing game in Steam, same goes with installing mods.   I totally recommend DST: it’s basically endless game with tons of possibilities, actively supported by developers and community. Good way to start was suggested by my good friend: just watch fourteen hours of “How to…” videos on youtube, and you are ready to starve and die.   ",1529833160,True

76561198006838480,"Very enjoyable experience overall, one of the few games that I would show to people and not feel bad for doing so.  Art style heavily influenced from Burtonland. Developers actually care about their community and talk with them as well as actively fix bugs from their bug reporter. Monster AI is predictable and combat is pretty one dimensional, like Dark Souls but with less choices on weapon behaviours.  Game won't hold your hand when playing, so discovery is half the battle. That being said for someone who knows what they're doing the game currently has little to offer, and it is easy to be ""unkillable"" in less than 20 in-game days- the state where the player is prepared for anything that is thrown at them.  Through the Ages content should give more ""end-game"" activities, but it is not here yet as of this review.  The game can be compared to building a card house or sand castle. It is easy to do once you've mastered the skills, but it is just as easy to make a mistake and watch it all crumble.  Update: Because Steam Awards demand it.  Klei has continued to show support for this title over time and still talks to their users on their forums.

Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!  Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge!   Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!  The game is smooth, no bugs (that i have found currently) and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something.

Almost 99% of the time i join to a new server, more than half the world is already burnt.  in general, a little status about the world before joining in would be nice... as for the pyromaniacs, not sure what can be done, but sure are annoying.

76561198044189299,"The base game is solid, no bugs or problems when me and my boyfriend played, however so far the game is simply different versions of survival mode.   Adventure mode doesn't exist in the game and thus there is no challenge other than surviving as long as you can which, while fun for a few runs, is entirely boring once you hit the plateau of having everything and surviving is no longer a challenge. This is a game with no real end goal or reward, currently.    Original Don't Starve along with the expansions is worth your money more (at this point) if you want a truly fun Don't Starve experience reason to move forward and greater challenges.  You may be able to play with a friend, (which is excellently done I can't stress enough) but with nothing to do but live on forever what's the point in continuous play? However, this is still early access, and hopefully their expansion (to come Spring 2015) will give more reason to play together, as well as encompassing all their other expansions into it as well.   Other than that, hosting and joining servers is flawless. The worlds are exactly the same as Original Don't Starve, with some things from other expansions and new never before seen events and creatures too. It's solid as a whole, but if you're looking for something to play more than once, wait a little longer until they add more to it.

Don't starve together has some features that the original game doesn't but I heard that the developers are working on changing that. Dst is a fun game to play if you want to build up a base with friends or with some people who decides to join your world, if you make it public. I've had plenty of games where I helped fight deerclops with some strangers or had to revive my whole team after a failed boss battle or a hound wave. The game has it's ups and downs but there's more ups than downs. Sure, sometimes there is a grief or your base bursting into flames during summer, but that's all part of the experience.   I can rant on and on about how great the game is but there is a big downside to it if you're not used to games like it. You put in a lot of time and effort into your worlds. To running around grabbing grass and twigs, to building up your base and making farms, to surviving hound attacks, and to dealing with seasonal bosses that can destroy an unprepared person with ease. The game runs on a high risk, high reward style and boy, there's a lot of risks. If you're not the type of person who likes to put in a lot of effort and time into a game or you get bored easily, then this game isn't for you.  Sometimes a single mistake by a teammate or yourself can take away all of that progress you made.  Please, look at the game before you spend money on it. Don't get it if your friend is playing it and you just want to fit in. Buy it if you're going to play it with your friends, by yourself, and with random people in servers. I have a friend who bought it just because I play it and only put in a few hours into it before getting bored of it. Don't be a Chris. (Sorry Chris if you somehow read this.

In my opinion, ever since I played Don't Starve in alpha state on Google Chrome, I felt like it would be a fantastic co-op or even versus experience and the steam numbers don't lie, everyone loves Don't Starve Together!  Every character is unique and those specialties are even more colorful in multiplayer as you can take on different roles that you are suited for in your co-op or group play.   If you enjoyed Minecrafts vanilla survival experience but now want a much deeper and more challenging adventure, take the leap and jump into the world of DST!  Note: from here on out (since launch) the base game and Don't Starve Together will have diverging content updates which means that there will be content not included from the base game and vice versa.  Note: in the description it is called ""expansion"" but it is entirely a seperate game, you don't need the original game to play this.   Note: for multiplayer it says (Co-Op) but you can't share screens and you need 2 versions of the game.  Note: game uses Steam Workshop, so you can download tons of mods and that includes some modded in characters from the original game's new expansion ""ShipWrecked"".

76561198202848659,"Don't Starve Together is possibly the best multiplayer game I have ever played. Nay, possibly the best game, period.  When I first started playing, I could barely survive on my own. I was in constant fear of starving to death, going insane, and running for my life from bloodthirsty packs of hounds. I was dying a lot and most of the time it was my own fault. I kept playing though because with each death I learned a little more about how to better survive the next world.  The best part of this game has to be the friendly community. I always love joining a random server and being greeted with a friendly ""hello"" usually followed by directions to a base. I learned most of my Don't Starve skills from more experienced players who offered their help and advice. Now I happily do the same thing for new players. It's a great feeling knowing that people are enjoying the game more because of me.  If you ever get bored of the normal gameplay there are also tons of great mods on the steam workshop. Not to mention that this is still getting updates to the vanilla game. This game already has so much fun content in my opinion but the fact that it's still being updated is amazing. I'd like to thank the devs for making this awesome game and for their continued support of it.  What, you still haven't decided if you should get this game?

If they requested anything other than meatballs, I'd tell them the alternative was wet goop, so they accepted it and moved on, enjoying my balls of meaty goodness.   My secret recipe was the most guarded thing in the server, and I would be paid in large quantites of gold nuggets for my juicy balls of goodness. Everything was happy and good, until a curious Webber snuck into my crock pot facility when I was busy burning down a forest and enjoying the screams of innocent rabbits.  The Webber soon figured out my ultimate meatball recipe: 3 pieces of ice and a rotten morsel.  As he tried to run out my base and expose my delicious massive balls, a boomerang smacked him across the head, knocking him out. I don't know who threw the boomerang, and I don't know where he's gone. It truly is a tragedy, and everyone mourned over his loss.

76561198066905165,"I must be one of the only few people who is not enthusiastic about Don't Starve. I definitely recognise it has a lot of qualities. Nice hand-drawn graphics, a real universe of its own with funny characters and monsters and a lot of imagination. The concept itself is original: a mixture of craft and survival with a strong emphasis on the survival part, rather than on the building part. And you can play it multiplayer, that's great !  So why the thumb down ? Well in this kind of game, the aspect I usually like is the building part. You farm, you collect, you build, and you let your own imagination decide how your camp is going to look like, what gears you're gonna craft to go hunting, etc. However, the very core of the game is the constant pressure that you have little time to gather food, handle your health, mental health and hunger at the same time, and still build the things that are necessary to survive the winter and the monsters. Consequently, the creative part is totally overshadowed by the need to survive (at least for low-level players like me).   Furthermore,  the game, from its title to the essence of its gameplay, cynically pushes you to see how long you can survive, because you'll eventually die, it is just a matter of when and how. And surviving is merely rewarded by your score, i.e., the number of days you spend before dying. The worst part for me is the absence of Steam achievement to motivate me to try and try again. I die ? Well I can launch a new game, but maybe just to die a little later, which means at best discovering a few more mobs or objects and... that's it. Well, sorry guys but that can't keep me motivated.  Not a bad game by any mean, but not oriented towards creativity, and not rewarding enough for me.",1552333246,False

76561198052586802,"My review about this game was originally a silly joke in the form of a satirical in-game scenario, but I feel like I really need to do it some justice. Don't Starve Together, ideally, is just that: Don't Starve, but Together, with other people, normally with your friends since public servers are admittedly going to generally be pretty toxic. However, it is still perfectly playable solo, and there's so much more to the game than just being a multiplayer version of its predecessor. The team behind it seems genuinely passionate about what they're doing, so much so that some of it even rubs off on the workshop and the creators of a lot of the mods in it. They even gave Don't Starve Together away to owners of Don't Starve for FREE back when it was still in the beginning of its early access stage, and INCLUDED all the DLC they had for the latter game at the time.  To start, if you don't know what Don't Starve (Together) is, it's probably one of the oldest, truest, and all-around best survival sandbox games out there. It has a unique artstyle, some interesting lore, and easy-to-learn but still always threatening and challenging gameplay. After hundreds of hours, I'm still learning and being amazed, or, at the very least, intrigued by a lot of the things I still don't know about that I accidentally stumble upon while playing. It's truly a new experience every time. It also doesn't have the problem almost every ""survival game"" out there has nowadays, too, with being very one-dimensional, predictable, or feeling just like one of those dime-a-dozen copies of popular representatives of the genre. There's so much you can customize for each individual world, both the good and the bad, the objects and the mechanics, it's just overall very customizeable, which is always a welcome feature, especially to the picky folk or perhaps the type who easily get bored of games with one or very few different settings, and that's not even mentioning the mods.  Oh gosh yes, the workshop. It's absolutely wonderful. Although a lot of people can agree that making and maintaining mods for the game can be very difficult and ""time consuming and a mess of coding"" in the game's current stage, the level of activity and additional customization that can be found in the workshop is amazing and provides virtually unlimited replayability to the game.  Honestly, to any modders reading this who still support their mods, I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm genuinely thankful for what you're doing. You make the community and the game even more awesome than it already is, and it wouldn't quite be what it is without all of your contributions. Unless all you do is make reskinned Wilsons of anime, pony, or FNaF characters with nothing more than a buff to the base character stats. Seriously, cut that out. It's embarrassing for everyone.  This is also the only game I know of with an in-game market worthy of mentioning without some stupid desperate attempt to grab your cash for every box you want to open. You get free boxes of cosmetic items for your characters just by playing, and can also open them... for free! And you can even buy and sell them on the Steam market, and recycle them with a function in game.  Seriously, I can't think of any downsides with this game--even if I could, the good most certainly outweighs the bad--and it's tough to imagine Klei bailing out on development and letting us down. So why haven't you gotten this game yet? The devs deserve your support and you deserve to give yourself a quality time killer!",1486956737,True

I'll keep it kind of short for this one, as I'm sure I'll have to update it many times in the future as Klei decides to host more events and push out more content for this game.   As you can see, I've spent a lot of time in this game, and truly it feels like barely any time at all. Time passes at supersonic speed when playing this game with a good group of buddies, and it's honestly impossible to not make friends while playing this. Every single friend on my steam list is someone I either met from this game or someone I made buy the game and play it with me.   This game is grindy and never ending, there are seasonal events every year with new content to explore and new cosmetic drops to collect. There are also random events that change the game entirely, one being a crazy ranked nonstop battling competition that even had people screaming about nerfs and metas and yelling at each other as if we were playing League. The other random event that recently took place was similar to an Overcooked style of gameplay and was very hectic and fun. There is also random puzzles that are released and involve team work to unlock special skin prizes.   I've been pretty active in the forums for this game and have watched many, many streams or YT videos of it, as well as playing in every event. So I definitely have a good grasp on this one.   This is a surivial game that allows you to spend all your time exploring, farming, battling bosses or dungeon crawling the caves. There is a lot going on in this one, and I have tried to find many games ""similar to Don't Starve Together"" and none compare. There is just something about how this game will literally allow you to do anything or play to any style and look so nice artwork wise as well, that just can't be compared in other surivial games.   TONS of lore that is constantly being expanded on and explained, a huge world with options to increase or decrease any aspect of it, including difficulty. Can play with any number of friends, and while people tend to talk about a difficulty curve in this game, I really do not think this is that hard and anyone can learn to play it and ""not starve"". Though dying to random BS is probably more likely than starving....   The workshop makes this game never boring as it allows creativity to flow to the max. I've played TF2 battle royale type games with some friends, and been in servers that were practically VRChat level of roleplaying and BS. You can make this more like Animal Crossing if you want, or more like a horror game, or more like a PVP game. Literally anything you want this game to be or any character you want in it, the workshop will have it. This game can't be recommended enough and can fit anybody expectations.

Также, как и в любой другой игре, нам предоставляется возможность скачать несколько интересных модов, созданных самими игроками.   В этот раз, разработчики нас удивили тем, что добавили возможность кооператива. Теперь, можно играть не только одному, но и с друзьями! ;) Это придают большей интриги и интереса. Выживать вместе намного проще, чем одному, ведь так? Я считаю, что эта возможность безоговорочно занимает одно из важных мест по меркам в играх.

When i play this beautifully crafted game, i feel like i am wondering about a Tim Burton film. It's a welcome change from the normal survival game interface and artwork, much like its' sister product ""dont starve"".  Second, the way you evolve with your character. At first glance, you seem like a cave man who just woke up and needs to eat, but when you find some berries and get fed, you instantly start scrounging around for grass, twigs and flint. You make an axe and start to collect wood logs. OH NO IT'S NIGHT TIME WE GON DIEEEEE. You now have to make a fire. All of these simple beginners steps turn your caveperson like sprite, into a brave warrior who fights wolves from hell, living trees, and a huge deer with one eye whos one wish in life is to crush you and your friends hard work (and or skulls).  Finally, whatever else is good about ""dont starve"", its twice as good in this game.   ""why?""

76561198078352845,"One of my Sperglord friends told me that I wrote ""butterflies"" incorrectly on the previous version of this review. So this review just turned into a grammar lesson about the plural form of nouns that end with ""y"".  [b] Ahem... [/b]  How do you form the plural of a proper noun that ends in y such as Murphy? Should you change the name to Murphies? Given how other English words ending in y form their plurals, you would think so. Examples: puppy / puppies army / armies supply / supplies  However, proper nouns are not pluralized the same way common nouns are. Rule: Do not change the spelling of a name to make it plural. Instead, just add s. Examples: I visited the Murphys last weekend. We have two Zacharys in our office.  What if you want to show possession with a name that ends in y? Rule: To show singular possession, use the apostrophe and then the s. Example: I petted Mrs. Murphy’s cat.  Rule: To show plural possession, make the proper noun plural first, then use the apostrophe. Examples: I petted the Murphys’ cat. I visited the Murphys’ store on Main Street.  Rule: To show the plural of a name that ends in s, ch, or z, add es. Examples: The Sanchezes will be over soon. The Thomases moved away.   Hope you're fucking happy.",1427405031,True
76561198012105681,"Original Don't Starve always left me with an odd and uncomfortable feeling of loneliness. It may be considered a part of the atmosphere - your character is stranded in a hostile environment, after all. But still, it became tiresome after some time.  Now, you can invite a friend to share the game world. Delegate tasks, feed each other, support your companion in battle with nature and elements, or suddenly leave your friend to be devoured by hounds while you escape! Instant fun! It's a bit tough that you can't pause the game, though. Don't starve is a time-consuming game, and when you play in company, someone is bound to be distracted from the game at some point.

76561198009474997,"Don't Starve Together Review  Not just another expansion, but a fully standalone multiplayer version of the game we have come to love and hate with the same heart.  Some key points that this game add on has to offer:  1.	Fully standalone multiplayer game. 2.	Co-op survival or PVP. 3.	Create your own local, private or open server for up to 6 players. 4.	The Gorge Event to offer a reason to always want to come back. 5.	Everything we have in Don’t Starve we almost have here but now we get to enjoy it with friends.  Replayability:  It goes without saying that this game requires replays so we won’t go into it here, it is a requirement by now, Don’t starve until you do, then you die and get XP based on how long you survived, XP unlocks new characters for you to try out.   MGRza’s Conclusions:  This game isn’t just another expansion but gives us a brand new game in multiplayer so that we can play with friends or new comers in the same world we have come to know, Don’t Starve together also includes Reign of Giants; adding new characters, seasons, creatures, biomes, and giant new challenges for you to undertake either solo or with a couple of friends. You can start the game by either selecting a random server from the available list, or joining a server created by mates or go at it by yourself by creating and customizing your own server, setting it up the way you want it, adding extras to it, mods or other add ons from the community and then when you are set you can make it public or private and once you are ready you can start your new journey and see how far you get.

Yell at the moron who put the beeboxes right next to the campfire TOGETHER (Totally wasn't me... even if it was, I never used one beefore) It was also fun to hunt TOGETHER. Trap those trunk animal thingies that I can never spell correctly, TOGETHER. Almost freeze to death TOGETHER. Ditch your friends and hide in a cave whilst they get murdered by hounds and a deerclops on the same night... (Maybe not together) Also fun to rebuild the base TOGETHER. And it was fun to try to avenge our friends TOGETHER. And it was (Maybe not so fun) to lose more friends in trying to avenge our friends, TOGETHER. And then losing tons of sanity to instant rain... Together... And ending our adventure to a frog rain and hound attack at the same time... Together.

Let's start off with the good.  This game is so much fun with friends and a GREAT way to make friends. On average (from my experience) the communty i friendly. It is Don't Starve, after all, so it's a unique gameplay and idea. There's a bunch to do, especially with mods. I've done everything form 1v1 tournaments to just regularly playing/surviving. The game is updated regularly and maintained with a close eye. I love how responsive the creators at Klei are. They love to stay interactive with their fans and fellow gamers. There's an interesting backstory to DST, which branches from DS (Learn about it by playing the CycIum puzzle). I just love this game so much.  Now, for the bad.  There's not much here. There are and always will be bugs, especially when mods are involved. Without Don't Starve background, the game can be a bit dificult, but that shouldn't be a problem with help from the other gamers (assuming your server has other people). That's pretty much it. The game isn't really bad.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who:  A) Likes survival games.  B) Likes games that involve interracting / making friends.  C) Likes a very interesting sketch-like art style.",1463250708,True

76561198012473463,"[h1]Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36214917/]Curator Group for more reviews[/url][/h1]  Don't Starve Together is a multiplayer survival game. If you've played Don't Starve, don't worry, this game is almost identical to Don't Starve, aside from the multiplayer capabilities and a few relatively minor features. Gameplay-wise, Don't Starve translates very well to multiplayer. It's easier to gather food and other resources with 2+ people, but more resources are needed to support the extra people. It manages to balance the game experience very well, without feeling like having extra people is a negative.  Don't Starve Together strikes a great balance between difficulty and accessibility. It is challenging but never gets frustrating or annoying. The rush during the ""easy"" seasons to prepare for winter makes for an enjoyable gameplay loop that is seemingly repetitive, but doesn't get boring thanks to the wide array of possibilities when playing.  The modding community is another strong point of DST. There is a huge variety of characters to play as if you get bored of the base game. There are also quite a few content mods, adding new things to craft, new enemies, new biomes, etc.   Overall, DST is a fantastic game to play with friends and one with a lot of replayability.",1580222888,True

76561198092751351,"Don't Starve Together is not just uncompromising but can also be unforgiving. Do not be misled by it's squiggly graphics as the real meat of the game is elsewhere. It has defined its own niche in the survival genre and has inspired a lot of new games in the process. Given the enormous amount of details that you need to be wary of in order to survive, this could easily be one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play and yet you may not hate it.  This game demands a lot of patience from its players and expects them to learn from their mistakes quickly. This game rewards forethought but unforgivingly punishes carelessness. The quality of your choices will greatly affect your survival process. The players will not just combat callous monsters, eerie darkness, and constant hunger, but also their own stupidity. This game will teach you to turn every lurking danger into opportunity rather than simply generalizing every outcome as either good or bad.  Pros: 1)The Game is rich with endless content that'll keep you curious and entertained. 2)Involves a lot of scouting, gathering of resources and their management, item-crafting, and base-building. You'll also have to deal with hostile monsters and an uncaring climate. 3)Good Teamplay will be a satisfying experience. Conversely, bad  team players will make their uninviting presence felt.  Cons: 1) You may die a lot initially before you get a hang of the game dynamics.  ",1521485357,True

Its the same as the original game but now you can play it with friends and other people. overall its a great game. 9/10,1479369594,True
76561198144736008,"First off,  this game is undeniably good, for his great community, mod support, and hard gameplay. For a dont starve diehard like me it's pretty easy to like this game, since i pratically loved the ""Dont starve single player""  But ill try to get in the shoes of someone that's new to the genre and the game.  -Is it good for a starter? Has it got some replayability?  This game is actually pretty hard at the start, and you need to get the hand of it, so dont ragequit if you die once. But the gameplay is solid and not repetitive, every world is different from eachother, and you can survive pretty much untill you get bored and you want to restart,and belive me, you will not get bored untill the 1000th day. But i reccomand playing a bit alone to get the hang of it hosting your private server.  -Do the servers cost?   ABSOLUTELLY NOT! You can play with your friends wherever you want and whenever you want. It's pretty much like Terraria and Starbound (NOT COMPARATING THESE GAMES WITH DONT STARVE TOGETHER, JUST COMPARING THE SERVER SYSTEM) where you can host your private server and let people join in, but if the hoster crashes/leaves the server, it will be closed. But if you want to evitate that and you have a  big wallet, you can buy a dedicated server and do whatever you want with it, since it's open 24/7  -Is it good to coop with other players? what differenciate this game from the single player standalone edition?  Well, if you want to play a hard survival game with your buddies, this is the game for you,and actually, having coop in dont starve it's not that bad,you can do crazy things with some character combos. This game is pretty good for your pockets and time as well! Since all characters and content for Reign of Giants (Dont starve DLC) is in there and all characters are unlocked, so you dont need to do those crazy things to unlock characters again (im talking to you webber). The game has a lot of new content released in the ""A new reign"" expansion, such as new bosses,new items, and overall a lot of fitting addictions in the game, that the standalone version doesnt benefit of. Another great featuers of Dont Starve Together are the gamemodes, instead of survival (basically you die and lose everything, such as the original ""Dont Starve"")  you can choose a different mode, such as Endless, (you become a ghost when you die and you can revive your buddies with a special item or you can directly go to the portal where you spawned).  Another thing (that i suppose some people aren't a fan of) are the skins for the characters and items, i dont say that is a good or bad thing, but thats based on your personal tastes, i personally like how the skins change the boring look of the normal character to please the eye a bit, but i dont reccomand spending money on them, or at least not too much, you know, it's not Cs:go where you only show off your knives.  -Are mods a bad thing? Do they ruin the overall experience?  It depends, again, based on your personal tastes. If you are bored of the base game, you can just personalize it adding new bosses/characters/items created by this awesome and active mod community,or if you want to just add some graphical/HUD tweaks, client mods exist for that! and you dont need to apply them in your server, so you spare some HDD space for your buddies. Overall, mods are an optional thing, im just here to say that they exist  -I hear a lot about seasonal events, what are they? Are they invasive in some way?  Events are a new thing introduced in Dont Starve Together to keep the game alive (as i think their purpose is). They mostly introduce new items and skins for a limited time (Such as the Chrismas tree and the ""Snowfallen"" skin set for characters) or introduce a new mode for a bit, that gives skins as a reward (Ex: The Forge, an arena survival based coop mode with classes) If you dont like partecipating these events (you are an horrible pearson), you can still enjoy the base game without any problems :D  -I got this game free, why?  Klei gave the game for free to the owners of ""Dont Starve"" before the DST's complete game launch   I am pretty surprised that Klei made such an awesome improvement from the basic Dont starve! Not just like a quick cash grab adding a multyplayer separated feature.

If u have gotten good at it and a bit bored with the game then get some mods in there! Mods are really helpful for beginners, like the No Death Penalty or Extra Equip slots.

If you need help, you can ask for it but I suggest doing your own thing for awhile until you figure out the basics.  Everyone has their own way of doing things - find yours.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I figured I thus might as well tack on a few extras, both to give some info for newer players, and for the Steam badge obviously.   The game itself has quite a well learning curve. At first, you're going to die, you're going to make unfamiliar and useless things. We all start somewhere. Eventually, however, you're going to find a strategy, whether it be ruthless slaughter, or base-sitting farming. Of course, the game doesn't give a break, and constant threats coming from all angles, keeping you on your toes. Both it and its predecessor, Don't Starve, share similarities and differences that make each game the same, yet an entirely different, experience. The game itself is superbly fun, but the only downside I see is that even with the new content additions, server optimization is below average, and even playing with 1 other friend living a state away from me with caves enabled caused the server to chug, and overall be unstable at most times.  TL;DR, good game, good curve, below-average server optimization.",1545326454,True

Recently however i've been permanently banned from the DST community hub just for voicing my opinion about this toxic community.  Let me state this clearly though, as some people have not gotten the memo yet.  [b]IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING THIS WITH [i]FRIENDS[/i] AND ONLY [i]FRIENDS[/i], DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS REVIEW. PLEASE BUY THE GAME, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER[/b]  [h1]#1: Furries[/h1]    These ""people"" upload as much furry content to the workshop as they can. At least 50% of custom characters uploaded the Steam Workshop are these ""fursonas"" or whatnot. These bipolar toddlers are god-damned disturbing as well. I recall once joining a server with said characters and seeing something along ""ohmygodddd it looks so hot XD"" in the chat, no I am not exaggerating. Say anything that these neglected kids have a differentiating opinion on and they'll introduce you to their fast typing skills of ""stfu"" or the classic ""YOU JUST CAN'T APPRECIATE THE FURRY COMMUNITY FAG"". Furthermore, I posted this picture to the community hub:  http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/366zzf (Furries everywhere)     Within half a week I was permanently banned from posting anything to the DST hub. And when I investigated by looking in the page source (They mods never specified why I was banned in the first place, funny) I found that I was banned for ""Offensive content and Spamming"". Neither of which is valid in any way at all. Most of the Furrys had the nerve to go on my profile and report a bunch of my other content. They managed to team up to take down all my Payday 2 posts, one of which had around 1,200 likes and was on the top Steam posts for about a week. To this day, a -year and a half- two years later my privileges are revoked on both hubs. Thanks, assholes.  [h1]#2: Kids[/h1]    I'm fine with kids playing games, i'm going to clear that up right now. But when you have 7-9 year olds playing online, always asking you for ""flint pls"" or spamming ""xD"" in the chat it admittedly gets annoying after awhile. (Thanks the Klei for not adding voice chat I haven't gone completeky insane from these kids.) This is fine however as they usually keep to themselves or just tag along with a friend, but usually this is not the case. Don't expect to come across any kids with respect for you or anyone. They also like to follow you around and steal your loot, that's cool too.  [h1]#3: Griefers[/h1]    Remember that game Minecraft? Well, in that game the multiplayer servers had 'Griefers'. These people would go around and purposely destroy other peoples creations. But in this, these people will play as the character Willow who starts off with a lighter, they will then go around and set everything on fire making most servers unplayable knowing that all the resources have been destroyed. Unless the existing players have some sort of plant and tree seeds stored away, the server becomes unplayable as it has no wood or food. This happens to most servers without some sort of anti-grief feature. Luckily, more servers are adopting new anti grief mods. So this isn't too much to worry about.  [h1]#4: Stupid people in general[/h1]    I'm not saying everyone is, but a good majority of people in the community are. From ingame people asking all the time ""how 2 I get wood?/"", and the community putting useless guides and discussions in the community, it's damn annoying.  To start off, ingame you're most likely to come acroos flat out stupid players. For example, this one time I found a pig village (An uncommon group of buildings that are accompanied by lots of food) I ran about 5 minutes to get to it, and I found a lot of berries enough to last me a few days. I then grab the berries and start walking away. Sooner or later come across the owner of the server and he said to me, (and trust me these were just about his exact words) ""wow you just took my berries"" Banned from the server, why? Because I took ""his"" berries. This was on an open public server. This is an uncommon example, but i feel like this game appeals to ""that"" demographic of kids, y'know? Like the Roblox/Minecraft/Unturned kids. Extrememly toxic and malicious kids.   And the Steam community is much worse. If you go on the DST Community Hub right now, you'll see many Guides and Discussions made by little kids who don't know what the term ""proper english"" means. To be completely honest I could write a book longer than the entite Hunger Games book trilogy complaining about how damned this community is. Take a look for yourself, you'll see what I mean.     There's my rant about why this community is horrible. If you're a decent human being who; doesn't jerk off to animals, you're over 12, nice to people, and has actually had an education. You should pat yourself on the back, god thanks you. But still avoid this game. (I'm guessing everyone's going to flag this for ""offesive content and spam"", right?)

The combination of 2D cartoon-style graphics with a 3D world was a clever idea and makes the game quite light-weight. The Together version is, to my mind, the most enjoyable when playing cooperative. Still, I suggest playing alone, or trying the single player Don't Starve first, for the max experience.  I also have to mention the mysterious analytics system of Klei. The game collects information about you, but it doesn't explain what exactly it is.

Once you realize you can make it to day 50 without much of effort you realize that going around a map and trying to loot different stuff is... yea, pretty useless since you have only one goal.

76561198081023231,"Don't Starve Together is a wonderfully unique multiplayer survival game. The survival mechanics are simple but fun. I can sit down for a while just picking things up on the ground, cutting trees, and exploring the map that's different every world you make, the weather and season even changes. Playing the game with friends is fun and adds more to the survival management of living in the odd world. However new players may be fairly confused with how some of the items crafted or found in the wilf are for and do. Not even I know what some things do exactly, so I suggest pulling up the Don't Starve Wiki to learn what some things do. I think more in-game explanation would've been very nice.  A lot of the giants, the bosses that wonder about or spawn at specific condition, as well as just some of the normal hostile mobs wondering out and about are frustratingly awful to fight, their attacks can stunlock you into taking damage in a huge chain and it's almost impossible to attack without taking damage yourself. One of the first giants you fight during the winter season is Deerclops,  a beefy big creature that spawns sometime in the winter to walk over to you to fight, you'd better not be at your base as it will wreak everything up. The problem with Deerclops is that his main attack is this punch that sends a punch of ice spikes at you, there is no way of attacking him without being hit because there is no way of sprinting away fast enough before your littered with ice. More forgiving combat would be nice.  For people wanting to get into this for a single type thing is not going to have very much luck, the mobs have been rebalanced for more than just one person, giving them more health and damage, making it almost unplayable. However using the Steam Workshop you can download many mods from many different people to make the game a bit easy on you. You can get mods that change the mob health depending on the amount of players in your server and a mod that allows you to pause your game. However I'd just suggest the single player Don't starve as it's more refined for that play style of playing all on your own.  Every week you can get some gift boxes and this resets every Thursday. These gifts contain cosmetic items that you can put on your character, they can even be sold on the community market as well as be traded so if your're into all that it's pretty nice. Speaking of characters, you can pick from many differnt characters with different traits, stats, and unique abilities. It's great to play with all the characters to see how they all work and play.  Overall the game is quite nice, I like the survival stuff in the game, the unique world you discover, the style of how the world is depicted. Despite the somewhat bad combat, lack of explanation of things, the game is really good and I'd suggest anyone who enjoys survival games to try it out. How ever people who want to play single player wither play the normal Don't Starve or go into the Steam Workshop to download some mods to make it a bit easy.",1491677855,True

Figured I should throw it a thumbs up.  The aspects of the game that I feel are worth mentioning: -If you do not have very good internet, the game's difficulty spikes because combat relies heavy on a strong connection. Otherwise, you are forced to deal with lag or just play alone on your own server. -Being good at this game is mostly based on knowledge. If you know how to survive and what does what, survival is rather easy. But there is a lot to see. wear armor lul -Events that are only for limited amounts of time that are inaccessible and apparently do not really profit the creators due to the cost of hosted servers so further reappearances of the Forge and Gorge aren't confirmed even if they are a ton of fun but I think there's a Forge mod -Barebones plot -Just getting through 1 season (which are 15 or 20 days on default settings aka the only true way to play) takes hours  I prefer Together to the singleplayer version because I wasn't a fan of worldhopping which felt like starting a new game but just giving yourself endgame stuff at the beginning of it. Together just has worlds that are meant to last for eternity, everything is renewable that might not be in singleplayer. But singleplayer does have Shipwrecked and Hamlet.

76561198067058252,"[b]PROS:[/b] [b]Rewards combat skills and careful resource management.[/b] Too many survival games either require an impossible ammount of luck or are easily broken with infinite farms: DST offers a fantastic balance of the two. [b]Requires constant adaptation to survive.[/b] Even very far into the game, getting careless can result in a swift death. The game rewards those who plan ahead and is very fair in how it punishes those who dont. [b]Lots of mod support.[/b] The community workshop and klei forums host a plethora of user-generated content, and there are dozens of tutorials for those looking to make their own mods.  [b]CONS:[/b] [b]Steep learning curve.[/b] Knowing how to survive requires players know everything that can happen, when they can happen, and what needs to happen beforehand. This can be especially frustrating for players attempting to join their more experinced friends, as they may make several mistakes and be totally unaware of them. [b]Limited creative options.[/b] If building magnificent structures is your thing, skip this game. Structures are very much function over form, and to create anything asthetically pleasing is very difficult without mod support. [b]No final objective.[/b] Whereas single player had a pseudo-ending in the from of escaping to another island and adventure mode, the only thing players can work towards is killing all of the bosses. For some this isnt an issue, but for others it may be a deal breaker. [b]Online servers require data collection.[/b] For anyone privacy-concious, be aware that Klei limits you to lan servers should you opt out of data collection. This also means you will be unable to equip any cosmetic items you own.

Since they all had minimal hours in the game, they must be noobs. Everybody starts off starving to death, getting killed by things etc. If you just take the time to learn how to survive it will be a far better experience. You will not only survive, but thrive. For instance, I was terrible at the game to start so I died a lot. Now I can solo kill Dragonfly and the other giants without much issue, clear the ruins with ease, and I often have too much food.

With simple controls and a simple concept (don't starve), you will be constantly thrown into harsh unpredictable situations in which every decision will directly impact whether you survive or die the another day. A great game to play with friends cooperatively which will test your chemistry to the limits.   I absolutely adore the artstyle & soundtracks. The atmosphere and soundscape never fail to create a warm fuzzy (yet dark and macabre) feeling as you play. This being said, it is an inherently ""grind"" heavy game and most of your time will be spent performing repetitive tasks (or dying).

76561198094323685,"With its unique artwork and mechanics this game deserves a good old 10/10.    Whatever you like survival games or not its a 'must play'. It is here for years now and it has become one of the most liked survival games so there re lots of gameplay videos and trailers you can check before buying. But like i mentioned its a must have and its really cheap for its worth.  pros: - endless gameplay with lots of content. - awsome graphics, sounds/musics. - very colorfull and changing with all the biomes, seasons, day-night cycles and even with random maps which has to be like a copy of each other but nope they re not. - even tough its a sandbox survival it has a very good story mod which is implented in sandbox play. i consider it a pro cos first of all you can play both sandbox and story mod in one save with same character without ruining or effecting each other. starting the story mode is even better. you dont just click a button but complete some task which re not given but to be solved as you play. not givin more info as it will be spoiler. - simple to play hard to survive meaning you can play with your family or moto gang. - runs smooth even on low spec laptops with all that shinny graphics thanks to easy to render artwork models. - bug free! yes never noticed any bugs. well maybe there is some but not even noticed so gues its more than enough. - for controller types this is one of the rare games that i consider gamepad is better. good support and even if you re not familiar with a controller you can easily get used to it while playing dont starve in minutes. well its a must if you ask me. - very active developers. every month/year i expect them to leave the game alone as its ok already but now they come up with even more content. - very active workshop. lots of mods new characters etc. - CHEAP for this kind of game and developing/support. really they deserve more for sure. - even if you say im done with this game (well yea after a year or something you dont wanna spend like 5 hours playing same game) you cant get rid of all those artwork, musics and all kind of stuff about this game. it suddenly becomes something like a childhood memory that you cant forget. just like a cartoon character or something.   well cant think of a con but maybe some can say its a bit repeating but to say that you need to spend at least dunno 3-4 months playing. also 1 out of 20 people hates this game just in very first mins of gameplay for no reason. dunno why maybe the artwork but yea thats the fact :D  so if you want to add another game to your favorites of all time list just go for it.

Oh and I hope you had collected ice or you will die from overheating.  Straw hats only do so much to keep you cool.  But that's not the end of it, nope.

76561198011399656,"A challenging yet enjoyable survival wilderness game. Servers are extremely customizable and you can pretty much add as many mods as you want. If you really want to use it, there even is a cheat console in-game. The characters are also diverse in their skill sets, difficulty level, and personalities.   You also receive a free copy of DST when you purchase it, so you can gift it to a friend.  Microtransactions are mainly limited to cosmetics - even then, you can get a lot of them for free in-game (though randomly). The MTs are also unintrustive, they won't nag you to purchase resources/boosters/etc...unlike some other games. Massive updates and new content are also free as well!    ------------ EDIT ------------  However, I do want to point out there are special characters you can buy with real money, but they are also craftable using (an absurd amount of) spools. Some you receive for ""free"" in DST if you buy the associated DLC for Don't Starve (single player). I feel somewhat conflicted about this because I don't want to see Klei adopting some of the nastier aspects of the game industry's business models (looking at you, EA).  - For some players, this is a time or money gate-lock.  - Spools are obtained via unraveling undesired cosmetics. - Spools gained are based on the cosmetic's quality.  - Cosmetics are gained randomly, with no set time rate* - *Cosmetics are given as daily log in rewards. It's a guaranteed reward, but definitely feeds into a sense of addiction (i.e. ""Don't miss the daily log in item!"")  As of this review, DST has a base price of $14.99. It's not a $60 game that microtransactions the living daylights out of its playerbase, but it's always good to be wary of such changes.

76561198013645715,"First of all, this game is close to my heart for it's style, all quirky, like a 90s Tim Burton movie, with great characters, different quotes and interactions for each one, so there's a lot of replayability just in that.   As a multiplayer game that keeps the challenging aspects of the original but understood that it would need a lot more, you'll find a lot of stuff to do here, even if you didn't like Don't Starve (alone? lol) at first. You can keep the difficulty and try to go as far as you can with your friends, but you could also mess around with the settings, make it easier to survive and just have fun, there's even a ton of mods made by the community that could change almost any aspect of the game that could make it frustrating for any type of player, so I could recommend this game to anyone.   Now, about the challenge, which is my favorite part of this game...   You have to spend some hours on it, it's totally time based, which means that as the time goes by, you get hungry and have to gather enough resources to eat (well, it's called Don't Starve), make it through the night, survive random events, defeat or get away from strong enemies that show up around you... And then, you find something you've never seen before or falls to an unexpected effect, it kills everyone, and you have to restart the map. Just to be clear, you can use the settings to make the game easier to try again or even never lose your progress, but learning after dying and trying over and over again is the core experience of this game for me, and by the way, starting a new map, wondering what you'll find - since it's a different map every time- and how far you'll make it this time is incredbly fun.   And if you're already convinced to play it and would like a piece of advice from me, don't look up stuff on the internet. As I said, learning through failure is a core aspect of the game, it's still fun -and hard- if you know about everything, but some of my best experiences happened when I was learning from friends and overcoming challenges by discovering something new through trial and error.  As of now, I've never got to see Summer and never beaten more than one boss (which is a very recent victory), and also never got to mess around with magic items, you could think that's a noobish thing, and well, it is, but that's the thing, all the stuff I haven't done yet makes me incredibly excited to find out what's next and keep playing.",1545251766,True

76561198081937354,"welcome to DST  where the flints are gone and starving is the least of your worries  11/10 would beg for flint again.   That being said  Dont Starve Together is a rogue-like survival game that puts you in the wilderness with nothing but your wits and your enthusiasm to not starve, easy right? So what do you do?  You run around picking up rocks, sticks, and other things that may or may not help you into your journey.  You will craft many things from the simple axe to gather wood for the fires to the  complex dark sword that will help you in combat.  You will discover the inhabitants and the creatures that linger around the world of dont starve. Figuring out which one would kill you is also part of the fun and probably 70% of the time that you figure out what DOES kill you is probably the time you are dead.  But that's ok, lessons learned and you set off out just to die again from another silly mistake.  the more you learn, the more it will help you survive longer. From days, you survive weeks. From weeks you survives seasons. From seasons, you survive years.  Oh yeah, its also fun to play online with other people.... Just remember to be nice and you will have a good time.  This game is worth your money and your time i guarantee you that as much.

The game design is incredible every time you load up into a world it feels different yet fimiliar and evokes different challenges and ways to approach survival allowing the game to feel fresh and highly replayable.  The crafting system in this game is by far one of my favorite advancements in the survival genre; you no longer need the craft on a table the recipes are available to you from the start and is conveniently placed on the left hand side for you to explore at any time with out the need of guides and walk throughs. The level design is easily the corner stone of this game making every enemy and NPC feel natural to the world as if they had been there long before you ever loaded up giving you a sense that you don't belong in the game space and are not fit to survive. I honestly felt bad the first time I cold-blood murder my PIg-man neighbor over a berry bush near our house and then ate him cause I was starving.

Keep hunger high by eating food (Not ANY kind of food, mind you. Monster meat won't do you any good unless you play as certain characters.); keep sanity high by staying away from insanity sources (being in the dark, monsters, being soaked in water); keep health high by healing yourself (There's both edibles and other items that can replenish your health).

76561198005299723,"I loved this game when it was released and played it to distraction in the first few days post release.    It's definitely one any  gamer should have in their games library; with some original ideas, excellent graphic style and decent  game play; especially if you are up for a challenging survival game.  For community members  who love open world survival games, this is an essential  purchase.    That said, what I find really sad is the extent the developers have gone to make this into a cash cow by releasing  loads of expensive DLC that to be honest adds no  new game play, just  new characters and items that  help you to survive longer.  This is great for those who have previously found the game almost impossible to  beat, but  the total cost of all that DLC comes to  almost £150;   when all those  DLC's do is add new characters with various special abilities, for example  the Wurt deluxe chest at £7.19 gives you a new un-lockable  character with  three  extra character skins plus  special abilities that include being able to  spot where danger is hiding in  the swamp,  can craft the royal tapestry,  can move faster while on the swamp plus several other  abilities and foibles such as  strongly disliking pigs (you can get this together with  a lot more stuff via another DLC for  almost £2 less), or the more expensive (£12.29) Forge Armour chest that includes  16 armours and pieces that give your character additional protection  to ensure your survival when facing  Battlemaster Pugna’s champions.  I wouldn't mind paying  money  for  a single upgrade that would add these extra's, but £150, that's scandalous and criminal.  Sorry Klei Entertainment, you've lost my support for being  such greedy *******  p.s. I've given this a thumbs down, but  only because of the developer's (or distributors) greed.   For the  original release  I'd give it an overwhelmingly positive thumbs up.   Theey should take  a page from Team cherry who  have released loads of free DLC for their brilliant  game Hollow Knight.

76561198022534487,"Mr. Gaben, reviewers, friends, and my fellow gamers: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence, and on behalf of my family here and gone, I accept your nomination to write this review for no one else but you. I thank Valve‘s Mike Harrington for that gracious chance. You’re a true friend and a great company leader. But Mike knows the introduction I prefer is a little shorter. I’m a gamer, a player and even a gamer, in that order.  I’m new to this review duty, and honestly I never thought I’d be standing here. I thought I’d be spending this evening with my friends in some random Steam game. Yet, there I was a few days ago in this Steam Store with the man who won 37 game awards … faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them … and along the way brought millions of new voters into the Review Community. He’s a man known for his large personality, his colorful style, and his charisma – and, well, I guess he was looking for someone to balance the ticket.  For those of you who don’t know me, which is most of you, I grew up on the front row of the gaming dream. My grandfather started to review this game, and I was raised in a small game in Origin. Although we weren’t really a gaming family, the heroes of my youth were Gaben and Vladimir Vladimirowitsch Putin. When I was young, I watched my Mom and Dad play everything that matters – a game, a video game, and a good review. I was raised to believe in hard work, faith and family. My Dad was a combat veteran in Battlefield who ran into gas stations in our small map, and was a great father. If Dad were still with us, I have a feeling he would have enjoyed this moment … and probably been pretty surprised by it. But it’s my joy to tell you that my mother is here, still in shock over the news I called her with last week.  Growing up I actually started in gaming industry in the other party, until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 4th President of Valve, and I signed on for the Review Revolution. The best thing that ever happened to me – even counting tonight – is that 31 years ago, I married the girl of my dreams … a gamer and artist. He’s everything to me. Let me introduce you to my wonderful wife, Donald Trump. And regardless of any title I ever played, the highest role I will ever play is gamer. Donald and I are blessed to be the players of the three greatest games in the world … No Man‘s Sky and Star Wars Battlefront.  Proud of you guys.  If you know anything about words, you know we like to suit up and compete. We play to win. That is why I joined this review duty in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for reviewer who never quits, who never backs down — a fighter, and a winner. Until now, he has had to do it all by himself, against all odds. But this week, with this united review, come July 32, I know we will elect this review to be the 4548411246th best review in the Steam Store.  We will win because we are running on the issues facing this game, and because we are leveling with the gamer people about the stakes and the choice. The gamer people are tired of being told. They’re tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. Tired of hearing developers in all Stores tell us that we will get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of words on our children and grandchildren. As soe person probably once used to say, we’re tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant review can plan our words better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.  In the end, this argument comes down to just one important fact; So let’s resolve here and say out loud that Hillary Clinton will never become President of the United States of America.  They tell us this game is the best that we can do. It’s nowhere near the best that we can do. It’s just the best that they can do. Let me tell you, I know firsthand, it dow not have to be like this. In my home game of Tomb Raider, we prove every day that you can build growing graphics on balanced budgets, low prices, even while making record investments in my Steam library and Family Guy and a lot of bacon.  The choice could not be more clear: Gamers can elect someone who literally personifies the field establishment in the Review community, or we can choose a review author who will fight every day to make Steam Store great again. It is change versus status quo, and my fellow gamers when I become the author of this review today, the change will be huge. For years we have had fundamental problems in Steam Store that get talked to death in Valve, but they never get solved. They even get worse. We’ve seen entire stretches of our game the written off by bad development policies in ways that are deeply unfair. We see relentless mandates from the reviewer branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise, and no provision of the EULA is too large for them to ignore.  Gaben will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Gaben will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemy of our freedom. If the world does nothing else, it will notice: Steam Store stands with Israel. If you looked at the calendar this morning, you may have noticed, the review power of yelp ends exactly six months from today. This much is certain of the wall licker years: They are not ending well. There seem to be so many things that divide us, so few great purposes that Unitas as they once did. It is at moments like this, moments when gaming industry fail, but I believe we do well to remember what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in Steam Store. That we are, as we have always been, one game under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Should I have the awesome privilege to serve as your review author, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people without it?  My fellow gamers, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny and I have faith, faith in the boundless capacities of the gamers, and faith that God can still heal our land. But we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want an author who will protect this game, confront bad reviews, and rid the world of good games; if you want an author who will restore law and order to this game and give law enforcement the support and resources they deserve; if you want an author who will cut words, grow our confusion and squeeze every nickel out of the review bureaucracy; if you want an author who will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want an author who will upend the status quo in this game. and appoint justices to the Supreme Reviewer who will uphold the EULA; we have but one choice and that man is ready, this team is ready, our community is ready, and when we elect this review as the best review in the history of the United Nations, together we will make Steam Store great again. Now let’s go get this done!  Thank you and God bless you  And may God bless the United States of America.",1522153332,True

DST contains the highly requested feature of multiplayer in Don't Starve, though both aren't needed to enjoy the experience, since both games are really similar in terms of the actual gameplay. The game itself has excellent optimization and is a perfect six player experience for those of you that can gather that many and have fun in casual, competetive or co-operative playstyles.

They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.  And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4. With local co-op.  Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.

76561198042480202,"If you've never played don't starve before, let me tell you:  It will be hard.  You will die.  Starvation is the least of your worries. Most of the time.  Also, this review will have no 'spoilers' for what's to come.  Do yourself a favor and play a bit offline before hopping to online servers. They're likely the reason for ~1/3 the negative reviews.  And one last thing: You can hold space to pick up nearby things, and F to lock onto hostile enemies / living things you've recently decided aren't worth existing anymore.  Personally, I keep finding myself come back to this game, playing it in short - long bursts. It has so much replayability, especially in the multiplayer edition. Maybe it's the art style, maybe it's just to see how fast I can make my gear for the next season, maybe it's because a friend wanted me to play it with them. Regardless, every time I play it I find myself entranced once more.  And if you listen closely, I can tell you how your first few days will go if you've never seen anyone play this before.  Attempt 1-20: You explore about, not sure what to do as you gather grass, sticks, and if you're lucky in DST multiplayer, flint. Unfortunately, you'll die on either day 1 or two, further if you're lucky enough to have another person's base established (DST Multiplayer.) Unfortunately, you will die early on, and will become a liability at best. Of course, this will evolve, as you begin to question if there's any challenge to this game.  Either that, or you'll join a Winter / Summer / Spring server eventually (both of which have some... pretty nasty effects, to say the least. Best you avoid them.)  Attempt 21 - 100: You finally get the hang of things, and make it from Fall -> Winter, or Spring -> Summer. However, you've never dealt with either, so you find yourself huddled against a fire or a tree for the majority of it, and likely die when... well, this is spoiler free, as I said. Maybe you'll check out the caves as well, before quickly heading back up because you didn't prepare for it.  Attempt 101 - 500: Learn about the whole 'quality of life' items you can get - ham bat, pig skin, etc. Become decent at  kiting, basebuilding, etc. and ultimately find your niche in one of those categories. Question how the hell you live through summer. A thought comes to your head to go in the caves and just camp out there, but often times it leads to your death and quite frankly it's a spooky place to be.  Attempt 501 - 550: Start making it further and further through summer until you eventually make it through. Caves become quite smooth for you.  Attempt 551: Wait what the f***  Attempt 552: What's this guy doing in fall  Attempt 553 - 600: Figure out how to survive fall again.  Attempt 600+: Become fairly good at the game. Exploring the ruins is something you want to do, but you've never been down there before and - well, the cycle of the caves repeats.  I'm at the Attempt 600+ area, so currently I can't quite speak beyond that without talking out of my arse.",1480750282,True
76561198254233162,"At first glance, this game sounds very boring, the graphics looks boring too.  My friends recommended this game to me when it first came out. That was 2 years before I bought it.  The reason why I bought DST is because my friend recently asked me if wanted to play and he told me to give it a try after I told him I didn't have the game.  And trust me I have no regrets, none at all.  This game is especially fun with friends, everyone trying to survive together and some occassionally dying on purpose to troll everyone else.  The graphics at first glance might seem weird but trust me, you'll learn to adapt pretty quickly like how the thousands of people that bought this game did.  TL DR  Pros:  Entertaining with friends but still fun when playing alone with mods installed  Has console commands enabled for trolling etc  Not easy when just starting but easy to get the hang of  Troll enabled (definitely a pro)  Not pricey considering how fun it is  Cool names for characters and mobs  Cons:  Slight crashes with certain mods enabled  Max player in a server is 6 (shouldn't matter if u have no friends)  Not easy to make dedicated server  The type of game that gets boring after playing alot (Edt: Surprisingly still good after 2 years)",1521528782,True
76561198052259564,"I was never able to really get into the game or learn it, the mechanics are shrouded in mystery unless you spend time reading up on them on a wiki and Im as far from a fan of reading up on games to be able to enjoy them as can be. I wanna learn as I go and learn by trial and error, not by reading the answers or fumbling blindly in the dark hoping to hit something useful, thats a waste of my time.  With that being said, I still recommend this game. Klei entertainment is easily one of the best studios there is when it comes to your moneys worth. They have special event for every season and are STILL developing more content for this more than 2.5 year old game, with Hamlet just going into early access. I remember back when Dont Starve together came out, you couldnt even buy it, you wanna know why? Because it was free with the base game. They god damn developed multiplayer to their single player game and didnt charge their existing customers a penny for it. They possess a huge quality of respect and care for their fans and customers and even though I dont like to play Dont Starve, I STILL think its a good game based on what you are getting and how the company treats you in return for giving them your money.  If you like management more than adventure, you should check out their newest title called Oxygen Not Included, I fell in love with it as soon as I started playing it and poured more than 80 hours into it on my first week. Some reading may be required on that, but if you have a good understanding of physics, you shouldnt find it too hard to figure out a lot of the mechanics, real world logic applies to that game in so many aspects in contrary to Dont Starve.  TL:DR If you dont mind reading up on how to do things in a game and the artstyle suits you, definitely get this. If you like physics based logical management games, go see Oxygen Not Included.  You will not regret buying a game from Klei Entertainment, if you are like me, you will adore them for the work they put into their games and the continued development they provide to polish and add to a game for years.",1544714297,True

[*] Locked characters can be created for free by unraveling obtained cosmetics and using spools.[/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list][*] PvP exists, but the game has never been designed with it in mind, therefore it’s imbalanced and completely broken which is why almost no server has it turned on, since wilderness mode appears to be designed for PvP gameplay, that mode goes unused. [*] Location matters way too much, in order to survive and progress long-term, you need to be near specific resources and biomes, making the areas where you should place a camp, be highly limited regardless of skill. [*] Goal of the game is about seeing how long you can survive, though after playing multiple worlds and going through all of the season, there is no reason to play and there is not enough sandbox content to keep you playing. [*] Winter is too overwhelming for players who have recently joined a server and there is nothing to accommodate them whatsoever, without help, they will die. [*] There is no end-game content aside from just killing every boss in the game. [*] Bosses usually provide items or ingredients that assist in surviving, but they’re useless since they’re obtained at the time that you’re already capable of surviving indefinitely. [*] Surviving is repetitive, you’re very limited in the way you can survive and you will mostly do the same thing every single time you play. [*] Survival is annoying in this game rather than strategic, like being forced to eat every five seconds rather than eating nutritious foods that keep you full longer and so on. [*] The survival in the game lacks the depth and content that is badly needed, such as there are plenty of crafts and food recipes, but most are useless because there are better alternatives which are more efficient.  [*] Game is far from user-friendly and lacks overall tooltips, which means you either have to do trial and error and memorize everything, use the wiki, or download mods. [*] No systems exist to prevent griefing, which is why most players are playing on their own privately hosted servers. [*] Developers have absolutely no idea with what they’re doing with the game, in the past they tried doing events which were essentially terrible mini-games that added nothing to the core game, now they are finally trying to improve the base game by remaking and adding new characters which allow for synergies. [*] Even for a PvE game, some characters are useless while others are just game breaking, despite character remakes, the most problematic characters have yet to be fixed. [*] Just like most Klei games, the developers never provide patch notes that mention every single change, you often find new content within the game that was never mentioned. [*] Mods are required to play the game optimally. [*] With the heavy increase in recipes, we're still using the same user interface for crafting, where items and structures are cluttered in tabs with no search bar.[/list]",1433572827,False

The first time it was asked, we got a ""Don't worry, we're looking into it"".  Two years later, and... Nothing has changed. They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.  ""We are interested in seeing if we can bring splitscreen to the PC"" ""It's not at the top of our list right now, but we may consider it"" ""We're looking into it...""  Two years.  And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4. With local co-op.  Now, while not providing local co-op (despite the many requests for it) for BOTH wouldn't have really been an issue... This is. The developers of this game have chosen to prioritize console players over PC players, which is made even MORE despicable when considering that they started out on PC. We were their first fans and customers, and yet, they've chosen to give us an inferior version of the game. We should NOT support this kind of decision, unless we want developers to continue treating PC players as doormats. We deserve the same game as consoles... Not an inferior version.  [b][i]Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.  If the developers of the game change their mind in the future, I may consider taking this review down.

Once you're comfortable surviving the night, you can attempt to tackle mega-bosses, explore the underworld and it's vast treasures, or even raid the Ancient Fullweaver with your friends.  As of 2019, Don't Starve Together is still getting regular content updates such as seasonal events and balance changes as well as new DLC characters and skins.

To the point: This game is good if you like having big goals/ or would like to make friends. 9.5/10  -FRIENDS- I've made many friends in this game, some of them are even my besties now. A friend introduced me to this game, a friend helped me through this game, and a friend showed me to a group of friends I will never forget. This game will enhance your best experience with friends as you fight, survive, and thrive in the wilderness.  -GAMEPLAY- Don't Starve Together is a classic survival with many challenges. I'm sure you know most of the basics like ""don't starve, don't eat this, and don't hug the shadow right? Let's skip that. There is a lot more to surviving than building spectacular bases, raiding the ruins (Mid-Endgame stuff), creating farms, and setting goals. There comes a time however when Don't Starve Together gets repetitive. You could fix that with the large amount of mods available in the Workshop, or try to set goals for yourself. Here, I'll give you some to work with...  -Raid the ruins by winter. -Fight all the bosses in a run. -Set Tusks to more or lots. -Long term Ruins base. -Build a huge wall separating a piece of land. -Play PvP with friends or strangers  HOWEVER... HOWEVER HOWEVER HOWEVER... This game has faults as well. As you know, some people are complete bum bums, and they try to ruin the fun like in most multiplayer games. This game has griefers. These terrible little creatures are fueled by the salty tears of the people who got their base ransacked by these little demons. Basically they can burn your base to ashes, smash it to pieces, steal, destroy, and just tear it apart with ease. There are also other types of bum bums which are very rude to others. This community is not perfect, but the risk makes it worth the reward.   Now if you're planning on buying this, you should probably know some Don't Starve Together gamer terms.  PK - Pig King (The Gold giver) DF/DFly - DragonFly (Boss of the desert) Griefer - Despicable creatures Kiting - Dodging an enemy and hitting it too. AG - Ancient Guardian (Boss of the ruins) Deer - Literal Deer, not Deerclops. Tstone - Touchstone (A 1-up basically) Quarry - A biome full of rocks Mosaics - A mix of turf and biome. Usually includes a rock biome inside and a pet cave. PK Forest - The Forest surrounding Pig King, Autumn colours. Roll - To roll a die. do '/roll' and you can roll a number between 1-100. You may edit this as well. For example: /roll 10D10000. The maximum roll you can do.  My goal for this review is to get you ready for this game, and hopefully I succeeded in that. ",1486191467,True

This essentially the same game, only with other people and that completely removed a barrier for me and other people who couldn't get in to this game as much as they wanted because it was singleplayer.

We rotate through games regularly, but we have a core set of games that are our bread and butter.   Don't Starve Together is absolutely one of those. Building a space as a team, desperately trying to find each other and build a torch before the night beasties murder us--it's magical. It's also uncompromising; if you have that one Mad Scientist friend who will randomly use resources in pursuit of his trade, he's going to get you killed at least once if he doesn't manage to wipe the entire group. Most of the usual Don't Starve rules still apply.

I played Don't starve and supported it. The game went through many trials before the mechanics that we know now. When I first played DS original version, not together, they had a point science level system, lets forget the pass tho & move more quickly to now.  Now the game has DLC's adding many new adventures, DST ported some while creating some extra content for us to enjoy over the course of years together. The standard survival with friends became something a little more different every year. If you enjoy survival, gathering, collecting, crafting, fighting, Don't starve has much to offer. When you finally understand the basic's & get a good understanding, you can look into workshop mods making the game more difficult or fun.

As characters with unique abilities, you have to survive for as long as you can, weathering harsh environments, evading huge scawy monsters and most importantly as always, not dying of hunger.

All the characters from the previous game are unlocked and you can play as any one of them. Additionally, having multiple players on the same map adds a new depth to the experience. You can choose to work together, hence the name of the game, or compete with each other to see who survives the longest. The ability to kill off each other by sabotage is a must-try.   Overall, Don't Starve Together is at its finest when you have other players to enjoy it with. Get it while the fire's still burning...

76561197998673576,"First things first this game is very unforgiving to the uninitiated, rookie players that know very little to nothing about ‘DST’. So I would recommend playing at least an hour or two of playing on your own in a private server world, before trying to play with others (and as always check the wiki, which is about half the gameplay right there).   A second recommendation would be to play with mods such as map and item tooltip mods that really help out the old and new player (and really should have been in the base game but Klei went and did a Bethesda) and they don’t break the gameplay from the original gameplay mechanics and are client side only so you don’t need to run the server, (if you’re a purist). You can also add more if you just want to play for fun casually and improve the gameplay experience, which manly needs to be placed into the server by the host (so no official server).   Lastly I would recommend having friends to play with on a private server because every Co-Op multiplayer experience is better when you can coordinate, work ‘together to survive’ and help each other to build your camp (especially during the winter season in the game). It’s also just fun, because typically on your own you will end up dying a lot from animal attacks, and season changes, long nights (a main reason people stop playing, though death is a gameplay mechanic within DST).   So  I recommend the game but only if you’re willing to learn the ins and outs of the game and ‘practice’ with trial and error.

If you have depression or similar issues, DO NOT play Wortox with other players. Whenever someone will die or be low on health. As the Wortox, you will prioritize healing and reviving them. Food runs out of the fridge? Your fault. So you start to only eat souls. You have to balance always losing sanity from the souls, always trying to regain sanity, and healing everyone with your souls. So you say ""Fuck the sanity."" So now you have to always be kitting nightmares, which you'll start to drown in nightmare fuel which isn't bad. Point is, playing Wortox will hurt your IRL sanity.

I haven't made any mods myself, but I've modded, mods, so I think that's pretty awesome. But anyways, now about the actual game. Don't Starve Together (or DST as many refer to it as) is a multiplayer survival game, except, you can technically make it whatever you want it to be. Sandbox if you wanna use cheat codes or just wanna make it your own world, Survival if, you, play it normally, and a lot of other cool things. There's a ton of creative and awesome designs that you can take part in. I think one great thing about it is when people use teamwork. I know that kind of makes sense, because it's a multiplayer survival game, and who am I to say that? I make a somewhat sandbox server with management and events and whatever. But teamwork really does create strategies and communities. There are also servers just to make things, and I think that's cool. It's a fun way to spend time with other people and get to know them.

Pros:  - beautiful arts, reminds me of those horror cartoons back in the 90s, edgy and dark - every characters have their own personality, skills and traits - you can fully customize your character!, from your own tools, to clothes and more - very addictive - many biomes, monsters, animals, and items you can collect - the game have seasons, weather systems and a day and night cycle (I mean it's a survival game, of course) - and most of all, they give you free for one of your friends so you can survive through the wilderness with your friend!  cons (oh boy here we go): - the combat systems sucks ass, WHY THE FUCK do I need to click so many times at the enemy when the left click also functioned to move my character. It's so hard to hit an enemy especially when the enemy is small as fuck, and some of the enemies hit you so fast , but your fucking character attacks so fucking slow - sometimes the character won't respond to my clicks especially when I ordered it to attack. - some of the events of this game will just piss you off if you never experience it, well it's a survival game I understand but, sometimes it's just too hard especially when the combat system is fucking broken.  8/10",1575442043,True

It has a quite a learning curve for new players, but once you start figuring out what to do and how things work, survival becomes so much easier and so much fun. I have created new games just to teach myself to fight Clopsy or Bearger who kept wrecking our sh*t every damn time!!! You will probably die numerous times from all the wacky game-ending stuff that happens before you master the ability to just keep yourself from starving to death - it is SO easy to find yourself in one disaster after another in an unfortunate chain of events (like hound waves at night in winter while Clops is chasing you down with no fire in sight or failing to remember Bunnymen hate meat and the eggs you wanted to use to cook Pierogi is considered a meat item!!!).

76561198105951465,"At a base level, Don't Starve, and Together, are good games. But this isn't about whether Together is good standalone, its about how it compares to the original game. Feeding multiple mouths can be difficult, especially for beginners, but it feels great progressing your base so much quicker with the extra pairs of hands. However that's also the biggest problem Together has, progression.  The story/adventure mode in the base game that allows you to progress through worlds to find Maxwell and essentially beat the game was removed in Together. It's understandable why if you've ever played it, there are some things that would really not work in a design sense with multiple people, but damn do I wish they gave us something, even a neutered version of the original's. You'll find that as you reach the mid game, you've got decent gear and a sustainable base, and you're thinking ""ok what goal to set next"", that there really isn't anything to aim for. You can learn how to make every item in the game, but that's really as far as it goes completion-wise. You'll meet most of the bosses on the road to the late game anyways so they're more of an obstacle than a goal. Paired with the fact that you'll be blazing through the game quickly with your goons, you'll find that there's not much left to do fast. Don't get me wrong, Don't Starve is fun, and this is still Don't Starve. It's just that veterans of the solo game might have higher expectations than what the multiplayer can deliver. Ideally this is played by people who have little to no experience with Don't Starve who can learn together.",1566353089,True

I don't think I could ever get bored of it, as every time I play I learn and discover something new. When I first started up DST, I was expecting it to be very similar to the normal DS, but to my surprise it's quite different. I love that you can unlock reskins and clothing items; it adds to the list of things for me to do in the game, as I enjoy collecting everything to 100%. And even though DS is fun as is, playing with friends really just makes it double the fun. My friends and I always end up getting ourselves into some bad stuff every time we play and it's hilarious; we play it almost every day now. There is one negative thing I want to say about DST though, and that is the fact that you can't see each other on the map. It's easily fixed by getting a mod like Global Potitions (really recommend this one), but I would've loved it to be in the game already.

Shipwrecked and other DLC:s like that of course aren't here though (duh). It has very good mods from the workshop, like for example Combined Status.

76561198115231116,"Dont Starve Together is a game with similar mechanics to Terraria and the same difficulty as Dark Souls (thats how I felt when I was playing it) It is one of my favourite games as it makes the player constantly uneasy and has many horror elements. When my friend and I played it for the first time he would always start yelling when it turned from day to dusk ,because he thought it was becoming night and we had no campfire. My other friend also set a light our whole camp during the winter as he was trying to set a hostile tree on fire. All I can say is that we had to restart the world because it was way to hard for us. This game is so much fun and even though Im still new to it I am definitely playing more of it. I would rate it 8.5/10 and say that it is worth your money",1561878858,True

76561198025644307,"This game is downright amazing. You're thrown into a hostile Tim Burton-esque world without any information and need to explore to figure out what to do (that's the idea in Don't Starve in general). In Don't Starve Together you can play with friends, trying to survive together. If you're new to the game then it does take a while to get into it and figure out what you should do, so expect to die early several times, especially every time the game springs something new on you. Once you get the hang of it, it's exploration and survival in a comically dark world.  One very big highlight for this game (and its single-player version) is how amazingly moddable it is. The developers did great work in that regard, putting nearly all of the game in moddable scripts. This means that modders have incredible freedom, and naturally that means lots and lots of very varied mods for a game this popular. Hell, I made a mod myself, for my girlfriend's birthday, adding us as characters. =D  I don't even like survival games normally, and I absolutely love this one. Highly recommended.",1561853718,True

Being a deity amongst the all powerful rulers of the universe can get lonely sometimes you know. Ruling my realm is cool and all but their is a real danger ahead. Galèwertone is going to awaken in 1 and a half cosmic calendars and we must prepare immediately. This colossal monstrosity will awaken as a small little planetoid and slowly grow but eating dead stars and asteroids with Vinthalu's offspring. Then it will go onto eating normal, smaller stars like that in your solar system and have the ability to produce supernovas at will like its nothing and will be constantly producing gamma rays that stretch 5 times as far as the Milky Way is wide. At this point, Galèwertone will grow to be just the size of a normal Homo-Sapian cell. Think about that, one of your cells eating your sun. Anyways, after a couple of eons of eating super black holes and quasars, Galèwrtone will begin to manifest itself into the ""dark energy"", as humans call it, which makes up much of space and grow to be the size of the Andromeda galaxy. This basically means that a giant, gamma ray producing shadow will be wandering the galaxy as an invisible and invinsible eater of light. He will try to devour all the light in the universe and split atoms if they get in his way and while this is happening he will constantly be getting bigger.

76561198171828363,"My Review Of Don't Starve Together  Graphics - 10/10  Aside from the gameplay, the graphics have got to be my favourite part of this game. They manage to give off this darkly saturated cartoony look, similar to Borderlands. And it has aged really well, partly because it's not trying to be realistic in any way, and also because there's no way you would be able to pinpoint when this game was released just from looking at it. Awesome job on the graphics.  Soundtrack - 8/10  Just like the original Don't Starve, doesn't get in your way too much but can get a tad repetitive once you've played the game enough. But I think the soundtrack fits the game pretty well and contributes to the overall experience nicely.  Control layout - 10/10  Nothing to complain about here, just your standard layout. Very easy to configure the controls how you want which is a big yes yes for me as I often find myself changing quite a lot of controls.   Gameplay - 10/10  Perfect, just perfect. The experience is extremely enjoyable and never gets old. The game is always demanding your attention, and you'll need to think and plan in advance throughout your playthough.  Game Modes - 10/10  Multiplayer - This is exactly what Don't Starve needed. And they've gone and done it, but better. You can join, or host your own server, whether it be a private or public one. And I can tell you that the experience is twice as thrilling playing with friends, it adds a whole new element and perspective to the game. 10/10   Singleplayer - Honestly I've nothing to add here, just the classic Don't Starve experience. 10/10  Mods - 10/10  Personally, I think mods have become a huge part of Don't Starve. So much to the point where I wouldn't recommend playing the game without them. Mods have added features to the game that hadn't previously been implemented, such as waypoint markers, a minimap, etc. Nothing over the top or anything, but they generally make the experience more enjoyable.  Pricing - 7/10  I wasn't too sure about the £14.99 price tag at first, seeing as the original Don't Starve costs around £8. But you do in fact get a second copy of the game upon purchase, which is actually a really good idea, so you could gift the game to a friend and get playing right away. I still feel as though it is a tad overpriced for what it is, so I'd recommend buying this game on sale, it generally goes for around £8 on sale. That's when you should pick it up.  Overall Rating - 10/10  Conclusion:  Brings an amazingly well constructed multiplayer feature to an already perfect game. The inclusion of a second copy of the game is a nice to have. Nothing but good things to say about the game, everything is spot-on. I would still recommend buying DST instead of the original DS even if you're going be playing by yourself. The price could be better, so picking this game up on sale would be a better idea.",1559165823,True

You start near a portal with your friends without anything in your pocket and need to gather resources and food fast because there are some creatures who will hunt you down for days and you need to be prepared if you want to run away or defend yourself. You will challenge the winter ,that means hardly any water or food,beside you can be attacked at any time either by creatures or players ( if PVP on). Even tho there are alot of monsters who seek to eat you, there are friendly NPC's ,or should I say neutral NPC's, who can help you sometimes; You can't really interact with them so you never know if they will attack you or not, but this is what makes this game so fun.

76561198009904132,"As EA once infamously said: ""the point of the game is to provide the player with a sense of accomplishment"". They were wrong. That's the point of DST!  This game will frustrate you to no end. You'll love every minute of it, except for the last minute when you get wiped out. Or that minute your base is on fire and theres nothing you can do about it. Or that minute you are 10 screens from home without fuel for a fire because you're an idiot and left it at home. Or that minute you can see a berry bush in sight but then keel over from starvation. Or that minute a giant bear shows up and smashes everything that took you 5 hours to build. But you'll love all the other ones. Probably.  The game has a high risk/high reward play style. first Severeal times will be a confusion fest as there is no tutorial and you learn to survive through failure to do so. Every death teaches you what you might want to try differently next time.   You'll be constantly stressed out on the default mode trying to prepare everything you need to survive your first summer/winter. And it feels epic when you do! Every time. In order to do it, though, you need to take some risks you're rarely totally prepared for: Kill a spider hive, attack some bees, hunt for those elusive gears you need to build that dang refrigerator. Do you hunt for food or gather wood you need to fuel a fire for days? Strategy depends entirely on the procedural randomized world and how you choose to create a strategy around what you find as you explore it. And your team's cohesion in executing it.  You can tweak the settings of the game world to make it as easy or as grueling as you want it to be. You can spend most of a game season preparing your base to survive winter only to have a lightning bolt or giant bear monster undo all your work in a horrible night. It's a rouge-like really so once everyone is dead; it's game over. It's painful to watch something you've invested in turn to dust! But that is what makes the game so rewarding and every minute so meaningful: is the knowledge that at any point a mistake could cost you the game. And when you make it day 300 it feels like you've earned it!  10/10 ",1550136128,True

76561198864070341,"Don't Starve Together is a nice game for people who like the charm of indie games.  The only thing you're supposed to do is survive as long as you can in a world where hostility is present everywhere among you.  Besides dangerous wildlife that does more harm than good, other factors such as sanity and hunger will be of crucial point for your survival.  You have the ability to settle anywhere in the world where you deem fit, be it on the surface in the marshes, savanas or forests, down there in the caves or even on the boats in the middle of the ocean.  Each biome has its unique traits, from special mobs to special resources.  Graphics are not demanding and quite pretty for many.  You can play with usually up to 10 other people on a public server and share your experiences with them, perhaps even learn something from the more experienced.  *Buying the game excluded from the bundle will also grant you a 2nd copy that you can gift to your friend or relative",1546335152,True

Figure out the game either by yourself, or by playing with other people (IRL recomended) that are as much of a noob as you are.

76561198395923768,"The whole Don't Starve franchise. Ooh boy, I started playing this game 5 years ago with regular old vanila DS. I enjoyed it then (also was really bad). Then with Reing of GIants and Shipwrecked I started falling in love. And finally, Don't Starve Together game came along.... At first I fell in love with it just like any other DS game. But lately it has been getting kinda stale. Don't get me wrong i do sometimes just get in cus I have nothing else to play. But that is the thing. Only then do I enter the constant. My honest oppinion is that KLEI really has to do something about the game or it WILL die sooner than you think. But I think it's slowly getting better and better as we go along. Granted I do not like KLEI adding new characters that cost realy cash. I mean you can buy them with the in-game curreny but you will lose a lot of the stuff you collected prior to that, but that's besides the point.

You could either have a perfect base but die due to lack of resources or you can spend 16 ingame days looking for a single resource and rise from ruins. Some features can be difficult to manage like Winter and boss fights, but there is always some sort of strategy involved. The Don't Starve franchise is all about taking risks, whether it's to venture far from base to gather specific resources or take a chance at farming enemies with minimal gear. Either way, this game will never get old with all the events and infinite possibilities. All you have to do is laugh at death and Don't Starve!",1544902170,True

Klei listens to their fans and bring out new content every now and then to keep the game fresh.  The only downsides for me is the lag on the servers (can't really be helped), and the amount of greifers.  One suggestion that I think is alright is to add a feature that is crafted.  This feature spawns in a boss that players have defeated (yes I know there is a console command for that).  There would be a vote to spawn the boss and a location.  To craft it, you would need the items from the boss.  Ex.  Deerclops would need the eyeball and the meat dropped by it.

Lo and behold here we are, and as I can see the community is still quite alive! Which is great, I have always loved this game. Now even though the whole surviving aspect can get boring and tedius after some point Klei was mostly dilligent with this need for variety and offered new and challenging adventures and stories for us players to explore. Ontop of that they added new ""modes"" such as ""The Forge"" which is running right now. They also allowed for a lot of modding which if I'm honest user created content makes or breaks my opinion of a game as I love highly customizable experiences. (I finally added a custom character of my own to the game a day ago) I look forward to anything new added.  My only complaints are few: There has always been a problem with the audio setup which completely renders any ""voice acted"" mods impossible. Which sure there's a lot more dialogue than one would think and it's much easier to just remix instrument sounds but I once found a perfect voice for Wilson and alas to spite studying hard on how to mod audio I was unable to crack it.  The other complaint is that in the forge when someone wants to troll they'll trash talk you or be a brat and then afk without clicking ready until they either get their way or you just rage quit. There needs to be a vote to kick feature. Now before anyone says that elitists will kick lower levels; that's fine, the elite can play with the elite if they want, or join lower tier folks if they want, I just want to lower the grief that the trolls have done to other players.

76561198844619277,"As someone who's been following the Don't Starve series on and off for a few years, it's amazing to finally be able to play together with my friends as we try not to die. And even though the name of the game is 'Don't Starve TOGETHER', you are able to create a server that allows you to play alone... but 1.) that's what the first Don't Starve is for, and 2.) the game has been modified to be more balanced with multiple people, so going in solo is a bit... hard.   The gameplay is easy to pick up once you get the hang of it, and you will quickly become addicted to this game as you try to survive further into the in game seasons. While it can get infuriating at some points looking for Beefalo and hoping to Charlie that your able to find one gear, the random world generation is what helps give this game it's challenge I believe. Maybe you'll get the perfect world, or you'll find yourself spawning in the desert with a boss over your head, possibilities are endless!  Speaking of possibilities, all the characters from the first Don't Starve are all unlocked from the start here, including a few newcomers in Winona and mod characters. Each character has a special set of skills that players can learn and can use to their full advantage to help each other... minus Wes the mime. He looks pretty, but he sucks.   But be warned; with all the craftable items and different playing styles, this game is a game where you require a guide or wiki. So unless your fine with keeping a seperate tab open to look at as the clock keeps ticking in your game, be wary.  Overall, I give Don't Starve a 9 out of 10. So remember, prep and hoard for Winter, keep cool stuff for Summer, and keep an eye out for the Treeguard.",1532223882,True

I would recommend getting Don't Starve Together (DST) over the original (Don't Starve, aka DS) for a variety of reasons.  DST comes with all of DS's characters and also comes with one of the DLCs already built in. It also has loads of unique content, including seasonal events, different dimensions, new items and monsters, cosmetic items, custom-build servers, mods and a character unique to DST. You don't even need to have WiFi to play. You can just make a world for only you, and it's just as good if not better than DS. You can essentially play both games in one.  The only downsides are this. -One of Don't Starve's DLCs (Shipwrecked) is not available to DST. -When playing on servers or connecting to other people's worlds, there is a bunch of lag if your WiFi isn't fast -The game itself is hard to master and can be annoying at first  Bottom line: I definetely recommend getting Don't Starve Together.

I'd prefer to have some sort of endgame goal like in the original game but not to say that there isn't one in the multiplayer expansion. The time I've spent in this game has all been a learning experience and a great, great, GREAT frustration (because I die a lot). However, along with those experiences, I have set goals for myself to survive a whole year or if I grow better at the game, take on some of the in-game bosses that one shouldn't spawn as a first-timer (rookie mistakes). The only thing I can ask for in this game is more friends to play it with, as after a lot of devotion the game will get redundant/boring as most do.

The original Don't Starve taught me a lot about myself, about time and resource management, and how everything I've worked so hard for can be destroyed in an instant.  Somehow, that's fun.  What's more fun is luring your friends into your crazy world and having them resurrect you after you made a bold and foolish move, once more delaying the inevitable consequences for your actions.

I hope to see this feature sometime in the future. Also needs to have an event related to extreme body hair, it would be ver appreciated to see wigfrid with some extreme leg hair. I also would like to see a skin that is completely hair. Just like in the gorge, instead of sacrificing food to a god, you must sacrifice the extreme body hair. But I think this game is doing great and I will continue to play it, but I will not get full satisfaction until there is more extreme body hair. Thank you Don't Starve team for your great acheivements with this game. I have such a fun time playing it, I really like the beefaloo, I think they're cute and really fluffy. I enjoy the time I spend on this game with my friends, we have once embarked on a journey and ended up whipping a giant dragonfly to death while listening to caramelldansen one of the best songs made on this planet.

76561198816697672,"Don't Starve Together is an amazing survival experience with its own artistic twist. To survive, you must be aware of your surroundings, while constantly maintaining your health status. Weaving through the harsh winters, and fighting for your life through the summer - this game has it all.   Details :  Night time is lethal, there are monsters you cannot best in the darkness.  Animals mostly come in packs, you must be aware of which animals are harmless, and which ones can be the line between life and death.  It's ideal that you gather as many supplies as possible, and store them accordingly.  There are giants that can be a serious challenge for the newer players.  Random events happen fairly often to keep you on your toes.   Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that really enjoys the survival genre. It is challenging, yet fun. You can create your own world and what monsters roam in it - which makes it easy to customize to your liking. It even comes with two copies, so you can share with your friend!   This game is still constantly being updated and given new events. It is obvious that Klei is still heavily involved with making this game as wonderful as possible.

After a few new worlds, you die little to none, and your productivty of building your base greatly increases. There is also a lot of awesome mods that people have made, which for me, enhances your experience.

How am I supposed to do anything if I keep dying? 4. I started using the wiki and now everything makes a little sense. 5. I'm bored.  The art style is great, the game mechanics are great, but #5 is the moment you realize that the game is all about being hard. Individual worlds are too small and too unrewarding to satisfy an adventurer, and once you get the information you need to play the game, it's just a few hours before you come to that conclusion.  Add the chaos of monster and resource spawns amplified by the survival environment, and you have another futility simulator. Add the ability to modify the very metrics that underpin map creation, say, filling the world full of carrots, and life's arbitrary value system floods the gates and overwhelms any idea of a sense of accomplishment, as fragile as that already is. Sandbox as a ""do what you want"" implementation is healthy, but sandbox as a ""none of this really matters anyway, right"" quality can be pretty uninspiring.  Everyone should play this game, if only to realize what it does so well and how that inevitably doesn't make up for the things that will burn you along the way and at the ""end"". There is no end.

You can install modes for it to be  easier or more hardcore,but it's more funny to play normal.      The events are the greatest! My favourite event is ""The Gorge"" , because you have to feed a  giant worm, and he wants different  foods. After you give it food, he will give you some materials and you need to get a key with these materials. If you don't feed it  on time, you lose.

76561198119319822,"I just LOVE this game. Id describe it as a goofy combination of Minecraft and Terraria with darker undertones. It's unique style of combat, loveably ridiculous characters, and immense diversity of content ensures many hours of fun... Not to mention that the developers are continually updating the game with new content and even special events. Whether you are new to the game and struggling to survive the Winter when your friend accidentally lights your base on fire or you are highly advanced and working out intense strategies with your pals to defeat yet another boss, this game will never never ceases to entertain, amuse, and occasionally enrage you. It is different than most other games I the genre because it is actually difficult and unforgiving, which makes it more rewarding when you finally manage to make it through the Winter... only to find the Spring even worse. It's science and magic elements make the game both more strategic and more hilarious. The only two problems with this game are that the constant updates somewhat cut down on the game's originally simplistic playstyle and that several of the characters have been given overhauls to try to make them more multiplayer-friendly, which have instead made them more difficult and less fun to play, while making them less valuable to the team. Fortunately, only a couple characters have this problem (Willow and Woodie). Overall, this game more than makes up for its negatives by being incredible fun, challenging, diverse, and strategic. And, of course, being multiplayer is the best part. I would recommend this game any day! Thanks you, Klei, for an amazing experience (with friends).",1512579354,True

Even after 150h + (and even more hours in the solo version) I feel like I haven't seen half of the stuff that's in the game. This is due to an unbelievable amount of Mobs, Craftables, Biomes, Food Items and even special mechanics. Also there is a system by which there are ""set pieces"" the world-generator can choose to place in the world upon generating it, many of which are quite rare (and also there are A LOT of them), so you will only see them after multiple times playing. (Nothing essential is locked by this, but rather you just find small new biomes or structures which you've never seen before.) And the game is still getting new updates and even more content.   Pros:  - Addictive Gameplay - Tons of content (e.g. lots of bosses, mobs, enemies, objects, craftables, foods, biomes etc.) - A proper randomization which makes every run feel new and fresh in some way - Still getting updates - Good variety of characters that give the game even more replayability - Seasonal events - Very humorous (e.g. quotes and naming puns etc.) - No loot crates, but an engaging skin system (which you get randomly by playing the game) - Challenging but satisfying - Workshop support and great amount of mods - Every characters name starts with a 'W'  Cons: - Can be very challenging for new players as it's very unforgiving - Might not be very accessible for people who don't have tons of time to figure everything out for themselves (Wikis can help get you started) - Rare desynchronization issue with ""the caves"" level (has happened two or three times in my 150h and required a restart of the game) - Addictive gameplay  Also it has workshop support, so you can spice it up in many different ways with the huge selection of mods available.",1511991170,True

Great fun to play with friends - it's challenging and requires intense group work, but it rewards its players with a unique and detailed world to discover and survive.  I also recommend original Don't Starve and of course, Shipwrecked DLC. I hope that SW will get to be integrated to Together one day, it would be cool to play in multiplayer.  Edit: Because of dedicated server hosting/configuration being such a PITA, I had to revise my review. I still love the game (and my original review above is still actual), but it is nonsense that I need to have programmer skills and multiple hours to get a goddamn dedicated server working. There are multiple guides online, but there are issues with many of them, e.g. containing wrong configurations and folder paths. Took about 4 hours to figure out how this works, with server mods, working configs and all the stuff. Server logs are too verbose and it's hard to find the errors in them, and it also sucks having to edit LUA scripts to configure them, and function calls to trigger any special commands. Take an example of Terraria, it's super simple to start a dedicated server there, even with mods (and world save is also only a single file).

76561198086096028,"So, I don't follow the whole ""Don't Starve"" Series myself. I mean, I legit just found out who the hell this ""Charlie"" is. And I know very little of this game. And despite my lack of knowledge on the game, I still manage to find out what I am supposed to do. Even though there is no tutorials or anything. Now, I usually like my games to have some sort of tutorial system, but that doesn't ruin my fun for the game at all. And normally I am not a fan of super over the top hard games. And, I do classify this game as that. But, again, it doesn't ruin my fun at all. Yeah sure, I sit there yelling at the game choosing a character for me, and only receiving that one character whom only eats meat. There has been a few runs as her where the world was generated just right for herbivores. Not carnivors. So, I end up dying... from starvation. Well, when I end up dying as Maxwell or whatever from the so called ""Darkness"" I sit back, yell at myself ""GOD DAMN IT!"" then I just sit there laughing at myself, and just continue to regenerate a new world, seeing what lies above infront of me that will lead me to my demise. To be honest, this game is really, really, really fun. Trying to rush yourself to try to get flint, food, wood, thatch and I usually just make fires, I don't craft torches... unless I really have to. Now, recently, I don't play a whole lot of games, nor do I watch a whole lot of YouTube, I spend my time on Discord, and usually when I'm waiting on one person in particular to come on, this game is really, really, really good to when it comes to burning all that free time and the waiting time. My entire experience with this game... has been fun. I still haven't seen everything at all, but, even knowing very little, and yet still have a lot of fun with this game. I have yet to play it... ""Together""... legit... but, I don't need anyone or anything to tell me, that playing this game will only increase your enjoyment with this game. Saying that my money wasn't worth it... and I'm salty I can't refund it now would be a large lie. It's far from the truth. This game is so fun, amazing, so cool to explore around in, I couldn't want to ass kiss a game as much as now. This game has been really fun, it's way worth it's price. I feel as if no money has been waisted here. And... now, I can't wait to try out Oxygen Not Included... seems like one of my favorite types of games. So, if your a massive fan of survival games like me, whom also... likes co-op, and or pvp, this game has both. It gets really stressfull, and I love it. This type of stress the game gives me, I don't mind at all. So, if anyone else who has actually has experience with writting reviews haven't conviced you, then my friend, I tell you, your gonna have one helluva time playing this game. Crap review writter that has no experience is out. Time to save money for Oxygen Not Included!   EDIT; So, bit of an edit... I've gotten to play the game with a friend and two... Multiplayer is even better than being alone. Hell, more stuff got done, but my friend... she wasn't so lucky... Since I actually just learned that when you buy one copy of the game, a second one is given to you, for FREE! So you can give the other copy to a friend and play together! Which... I just love so much. Ain't no reason to not be satisfied. Ah... she just kept dying and dying... from meteors. So, my computer is crap, I still manage to run the game at a full 60 fps, but when I enable the caverns, then It's still pretty high frame rate, need to actually check. If there is one thing I can complain about this... is just... how you craft. As someone who lurks in Discord chats, Having to use CAPS to pull up my crafting can screw up when I use capitals or not.(Yes, I do realize that I can rebind the key... but the CAPS key is so much better to use.) But for those who actually plans to get this, Go for it, I never really planned to get this myself. And I don't regret it one bit. So buy this game, recieve your copy, and a free copy, wait for it to be ready to trade, and give it to your friend! Oh, and also, when it comes to hosting a server, pretty easy to use, and getting your friends to join, really easy too. And since I have crap internet, my friends would connect and lag to death, but not in this game! Which.... is neat!",1495879929,True

It seems to be inspired by the works of 20th century philosophers from Immanuel Levinas to (ironically) Karl Schmidt where (putting this in the most colloquial sense) the world is this horrible place that wants your scalp as a trophy, that wants you alive just to kill you, where humans are these horrible panicky creature with insatiable blood lust all the while the world is also trying to see that you die, preferably a horrible and painful death. Nothing is safe and there's no where to run (but home). it is only in the safety of your home where you can evolve into a better human (also as a better killer, if you wish so) with more advanced equipment, with shinier blades and otherworldly creations. At the end of the day, ""the weak should fear the strong"".

For those still contemplating as to which should they buy between DS or DST (source:reddit) hope it helps as it helped me )  What Don't Starve (RoG) has that DST doesn't:      Has adventure mode aka story mode that reveals parts of the backstory of Don't Starve that DST doesn't have (yet).     Content is more polished.     Dragonfly as a seasonal boss that comes for you during summer.     Has access to more polished mods that some aren't ported yet to DST due to the modder's lack of free time to do so.     Fire spreads faster, way faster.     Resurrection/Touch stones needs to be activated.     No ghost phase. If you die without an activated touchstone OR without wearing a life-giving-amulet(must be worn before your hp turns to zero) OR without any Meat Effigies in the world, you die and lose that world completely.     Upon death, you get revived at the nearest Meat Effigy. If no Meat Effigies exist anymore then the game revives you at the nearest activated touchstone. The game will use up all the Meat Effigies first before using your activated touchstones.     Sleeping in a tent/fur roll/straw roll is instantaneous. The moment you use any of these during dusk or night, you always wake up in the next morning.     Willow is fully immune to fire damage.     Woodie's werebeaver form works slightly differently.     Teleportato works and teleports you to a new world and you can only bring four items with you bring your whole inventory/hotbar and a backpack with you excluding Chester.  What DST has that DS:RoG doesn't:      Ewecus and ewecus drops.     Scaled Flooring.     Booster Shots.     Increases boss and mobs health.     Moon Rocks and moon rock walls.     More frequent Suspicious Piles of Dirt than DS:RoG even if both(DST and DS:RoG) are on default preset for it.     Mushroom Spores found in the caves(to get into the cavesbeta branch for DST, follow the instructions under Join a beta server.)     Telltale Heart     Whirly Fan     Stationary Dragonfly     Batcaves found in the caves.(cavesbeta branch found above)     Combustion works differently and much slowly compared to DS:RoG.     You can chose which Meat Effigy you revive from.     Armor has less durability. ",1489852145,True

76561198080167024,"I'm mainly a solo player, so I don't have much experience with the balance of having many people in one world, but the game itself is extremely well-balanced in my opinion. The more you know, the more creative you get to be with how you deal with things, but everything has a catch. Think you found a great source of food by hunting Koalefants all the time? Well, you might just run into a nasty Varg or Ewecus instead. Built your base around a bunch of Beefalo for protection? I hope you brought your Beefalo hat for disguise so they don't angrily maul you during mating season.  The only big imbalance is in the character selection. Some characters are pretty OP compared to others, so you could have a very different game experience depending who you choose and how you use them. Otherwise, you can't really get OP unless you've invested many hours and game-years into your world, and it's easy to fail like a total noob if you don't know what you should be doing, or simply lack knowledge of some readily-available solutions. But at the same time, failing can be totally hilarious and even fun. I highly recommend running around in a new world and just seeing what kind of trouble you can get yourself into.  I like to learn by looking things up, since learning the hard way is typically very time consuming (though world-rollback helps a lot) considering how vast an array of experiences and circumstances you can run into and how easy it is to completely fail without a few tidbits of knowledge. You're almost always on your toes, and every idea or option can potentially be a life-ending or life-saving one. Every second counts! However, if you learn too much the easy way, it does become a little less fun, since there is less to discover for yourself.  I also just love the art style, and there is a good amount of humor in the game with the designs of creatures, their punny names, behavior, and what each character has to say about them.  Overall, this game is one of my all-time favorites. 10/10",1488139156,True

There're a lot of things good for decoration such as wall, gold nugget... -Science Machine, Alchemy Engine,...makes the game is more challenging because that would be boring if you know all the recipes when just start to play. ►Resources: -Some resources is not re-spawn and I not really like that when I working on a Mega-Base.

76561198148428847,Great game love the survival aspect but I do have but a few problems. There is no guide on how to play the game. (Not by community memebers) I wish the devs. would make a turtorial and hold your hand until you are ready. To reach end game or even mid game is very hard because I sometimes have no idea what to craft. I wind up only making things to protect myself against the weather but that is really it. I would really like to see Shipwrecked to be a free update and sail around with your friends which could be so much fun or even make a free update that Don't Starve doesn't even have as a DLC. Instead of doing Shipwrecked they could do a space world (I could not think of anything and I would hate for a space world). I also wish for a Player vs Player servers that are like H1Z1 King of the Kill where you have to make weapons and fight other places. Also for the character Wilson. I don't really see a huge purpuse for him besides beard hair. He does not benefit anyone but himself. I mean he only has a positive which is really good but how it only helps him is pretty useless for your friends. I would a buff (for Together only) on him or find a way he could be useful like add a item. Overrall I love this game. Every character is unique and some take longer to master but that makes the game fun. I only survived until end summer because of youtube guides. 8/10,1485664648,True

76561197981780780,"You can play this game together with freinds for hours. The game is inexpensive and goes on sale on Steam from time to time at ""you just gotta buy it"" prices. Be aware Don't Starve is a single player game with lots of cool DLC.  Don't Stave Together can be played by one person but, shines as a multiplayer game.  Dont Starve Together works well on modern desktop computers. You don't need a high end gaming computer.  I purchased a number of copies of this game for friends and  family.  They don't all have pricey gaming computers.  It's very simple to host a game your friends or family can connect to and play together on a LAN / Internet.  A good internet connection is required for games you host that can be accessed via the internet. The better the computer you use to host a game the better the performance seems to be. The games you host can be limited to friends only or open to the public.  The host of the game can stop the server and launch it later and be right where you left the game.   You'll need to play the game for a while to understand how you might want to tweak in the next game you host. More flowers, no killer bees or more killer bees, longer spring time etc.  And then you might wish you could tweak things a bit more but, the settings just aren't available in the GUI.  Here's were game MODS come in.  There are some very talented people that have created and maintain MODS for the game.  The MODS can make the game even more fun by offering options you might have wanted to see in the the retail version of the game.   Don't Starve Together is definately worth a try, especially you want to play together with some friends.  The developer of the game is supporting this game with timely bug fixes and often adding new features.    ",1480050016,True

Good idea to buy the regular pack, not the one that comes with the regular Don't Starve game, unless you want to play the Shipwreck DLC. The Reign of Giants DLC comes with DST and is enough for hours of fun. I do stress, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. That's why its called Don't Starve Together in case you want to know. Playing solo is sometimes alright or with random players if you get lucky and find cool poeple. A better idea is send the second copy of the game that comes with your purchase to a good friend and have fun together. The game is hard, but you learn and adapt. Don't get attached to your character because they will die. The game can be scary when you come across areas or creatures that are strange. After a while though you will come to understand the world and the starnge creatures that roam it. The music also is just amaing and can make you feel dread to a point where you just want to build a wall around yourself and cry. The game is unforgiving, but that is why it is different from survival games like Minecraft or Terraria. Minecraft is for building, Terraria is for fighting, Don't Starve Together is for survivng the horrors of the wild and  trying to get by and eventually thrive in the beautiful, but scary, landscape.

But having played the singleplayer version of the game enough and wishing and wishing for a multiplayer version so long ago I can say with certainty that DST met my expectations and will surely meet yours. I've had a lot of fun playing with friends in calls. The multiplayer of the game is well-executed, too; so many games change core features of their gameplay in order for the multiplayer to work, but thankfully, Don't Starve is not one of those such games. Put simply, if you like the singleplayer, you'll love the multiplayer.  My only real problem was finding servers other than my own to play on. Don't get me wrong, there are hundreds of servers immediately loaded up when you get ready to play, and most of them will have at least a few players. But most of those are inhabited by people who won't talk or interact with you, which kind of defeats the purpose of the multiplayer, in my opinion. I always found it more fun when I had a group that planned to play in advance.  In any case, I'd give it a 4.5/5. The missing 0.5 is really only due to gameplay inconveniences, like Abigail and Webber.",1476923438,True

Offline mode is good, but Online is better.  I bought this game based by curiousity. No friends have played this. I didnt really have any interest in survival types game. The art styles (especially those creepy cute monsters lol) really catches my interest.  I shared the link to FB. One of my friend responded and bought it too (it was on sale. We bought mega pack) We played togeteher. And laughing like crazy on the first try. And then we got serious. But ended up dying more stupidly. lol. I told about my experiences to my friends. And then one more guy bought this game. So I had two friends that play this game. Then he bought another pack for his gf. So, three friends.   I kept playing this game so my friend said ""Whats so fun about this game?"" He ended up buying the game too, lol. Amazing. Four friends. Too much fun, dude.  I recommended this to my other friend. At first she didnt take any interest. But she accepted the copy anyway. We play together. Five of us. With mic. WE LAUGHED TOGETHER LIKE IDIOT FOR 89187281798 times. She ended up enjoying this game too. I also sent the copy to my bestfriend. And ofc, SHE LIKED THIS GAME TOO LOLLL.

But. youknowwhat? He bought the game anyway. (Perharps he wanted to join us) Amazing. Eight friends including me. I didnt expect it at all.  FYI four of us still have a copy so it can be twelve in the future omg.   So in a nutshell, I just wanna tell you that this game is really amazing to play with your friends.

I leave the base to save the ""Souls of the ignorrant"".                                12. I use the premade telltale heart to save one and craft another to save the other one.                                13. After they're ressurected I find the third and I have them all follow me back.                       14. Night comes upon the world and everyone (but me) flips. (Me - uuugh.)                                15. I barely save them.We stay put untill morning.                                16. We head back toward the base.                                17. One friend finds a tentical spike by a body.                                18. A bee attacks him and he flips (rappid tapping f to hit it).                              19. The idiot hits me several times and kills me. (Me - You idiot. WHY?!? I get you're a noob but geeze.)                                20. I tell them how to save me but they pretty much just screw off. (In my head ""screw you guys"".)                       21. I haunt science machine causing it to burst into flames. (Me - Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry guys. *Lies*)                       22. They franticly run around THROUGH THE FIRE. (I burst into tears laughing as they scream)                                23. They all die.                                24. No living humans remain in world.                                                                                                                   10/10   Would commit genocide again.

76561198053613267,"I would have to say that Don't Starve Together is a wonderful game, however it brings about some very intricate quarrels that make me still say be careful of playing a game still in it's ""Early stages"" because it's going to give you a rather difficult time. Having played the first game, and enjoying the funny commentary, the wonderful art style and the cool survival mechanics, I am excited to see what they will bring to the second game as time passes. My only problem with this game at the moment (and hope that they will get around to fixing), the rubber banding around when playing with friends.  In a unfortunate turn of events no matter whom is hosting , other players will suffer the concequence of extream lag, running in place, and of course rubber banding (bouncing from once area to another) and it makes it so difficult to play the game with others. So long as you are hosting, these problems will not come to you however your guests will not be having the greatest of times.  I understand that this game is still in beta and has much to be done so this is only until they fix the situation will I have a more updated review to rant and rave about. I would suggest catching this game on sale in order to enjoy the rather lag based concequence it provides at the current until this situation is resumed in further patches and so on. In the mean time those that can play via lan you are most likely going ot have a better time rather than two-six people just looking to have some fun on a sever together.

76561197994024789,"So, a few considerations. I do heavily factor in price when I play games, I also factor in multiplayer as my preferred style. I haven't played Don't Starve, only Don't Starve Together. The game is also technically Early Access. With all that said..  Holy moly. This game is great! For 14.99, I got two copies of the game, one went to my Win10 Desktop, and the second to my girl's 2009 iMac. We haven't stopped playing since, spending whatever small free time we have gaming. My friends jump in on the fun too. Considering we got two games which means to me, the price of 14.99 is equivilant to 7.99, and we've played 7 fun hours on it, it's got its money back already.  Pros: I love the graphics a ton. Its cutesy and on the unique spectrum of games. The script is entertaining, I either find myself randomly laughing, a friend, or my girlfriend randomly laughing or quoting their character. The pros and cons of each character are more entertaining than anything while simultaneously frustrating as they mean to be. It is a base building survival simulator with a lot going for it and despite the cutesy graphics, has genuine moments of OH NO. Like when I accidentally burned down my base and the entire forest in trying to fight a tree. That's right. Or when the pigs help you battle hellhounds. There's a ton going for this game and its way ahead of others in terms of simply being Early Access, to know this isn't even fully featured is exciting.  Cons: THIS IS, AT TIMES, THE DARK SOULS OF CUTESY BASE BUILDING SURVIVAL SIMULATORS. EVERYTHING CAN BE FINE FOR A FEW DAYS AND ONE FRIEND (ME) CAN RUIN ALL OF IT BY THINKING, HEY, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA, AND THEN DESTROY EVERYTHING WE SPENT OUR EFFORT WORKING ON. IT IS ABSOLUTELY PUNISHING AT RANDOM TIMES, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A CON OR IF I AM A WUSS. But really, this is the only thing that makes me slightly cringe in a negative sense. The only real con and its not even that bad of a con, outside of this, is a lack of explanation for a ton. I don't necessarily need my hand held, but in DST (not having playing DS) there isn't a tutorial or anything. There's a lot of 1. Guesswork, 2. Experienced friends explaining things, 3. Websurfing for answers. I spent last night reading how to survive winter and I haven't even experienced it yet, all ready realizing I may be screwed.",1444753224,True

76561198085499730,"Hello everyone, this reveiw is not just speaking of my opinion of this game, but my mates as well!  Don't Starve is one of many of our favorite games on PC/Steam. We were having lots of fun with this game until one day: Don't Starve Together Beta confirmed everyone! As soon as the game was open to the public we received it for we already had Don't Starve. We were so happy that this happened, I didn't start playing until some of my m8's wanted to play. So I started hosting a game and we're having so much fun 7 hours into the game. We've also got mods on it to make it even beter! Since it's still in Beta it is a little buggy but we're okay with it. It took me a little while to make and account because the Email wasn't received till later the day I signed up. But we got there in the end, the mods we've downloaded helped with some issues with lag and glitches, and we also got some of our old favorites from the original Don't Starve so we're pretty happy about that.  At times can be a challenge but yet a simple game, I'm not yet used to the attack style of the game yet but I'll get there, I'm more used to first person shooters, but I'm not gonna go there.... You choose a charecter and spawn in to a brand new world, your arn't yet to know what is expected to happen, but around the 9-10th night be ready, for there is a band of wolves that will come your way!   Also to fans and friends and other people the game dosen't take that much to run, easy to handle and a great game! I will also be recording this game with some mates after some time in the near future, so be sure to check that out when I do. Thanks for reading and I will leave a little ranking of the game below!

Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you to decide. Fact is there are still places I haven't explored in the single player. Having friends also doesn't make things any easier.

76561198058940882,"Don't Starve Together, the recent co-op add-on by Tim Burt-, I mean Klei Entertainment, steps up the already exciting single player original. Even in Early Access, you can tell that the transition from SP to MP is nearly flawless. The game plays just as well, and even though things like caves and various events aren't included yet, it's just as fun.   The only downside to the game is the people who seem to take a liking to ruining your world. I.E., a person playing as Willow has to be watched carefully, lest he/she burn your berry bushes, forests and various other items down before you even notice it.  That however, brings me to my favorite part; the mods. DST has one of the most closely-knitted mod community of any game I currently own, including a mod that makes it difficult for Willow players to light things on fire. Other mods include adding additional items, characters, etc. My current favorite is ""Renewable World"", where every item in the game respawns at some point, so you never exhaust a map of it's resources. The best part is that you can set the speed at which they respawn, so you can tailor it to your own preferences. They're all genuinely exciting, and can enhance your DST experience an endless amount of times over.

76561198261130419,"SHORT REVIEW:   This game is awesome. Worth the money. 1. It doesn't have great graphics like Ori and the Blind Forest but this graphic makes you fall deeper into the feeling of insanity and isolation. 2. It's a great with friends and you can have a lot of fun until you all die, rage quit and come back later. 3. It is very complex and you have a lot to do and even after you get bored there are mods.          LONG REVIEW:  This game is a piece of art. One of a kind. I have only played a few hours on steam BUT I have played more through some (not fancy ways) with my friends and we had a lot of fun. That is why we decided to buy it.  1. This game is made in such a way that it makes you think that you are doing great until you die in a matter of seconds by a hound attack or a disaster. Which is great and not great for a survival game. It is great because it makes you become better and better by not letting you get too far until you try many things. But it often makes you leave, to come back later better prepared. 2. It is GREAT with friends. You can have a lot of fun together if everyone knows how to play. You can explore together, fight together and die together. 3. The item system is GREAT. You get items fast and cool items are not that expensive. Also you can craft them. ( By the way I was taking about cosmetic items.) 4. This game has a GREAT community and a LOT of mods. So you will never get bored of the game. 5. The developers are very active. Coming up with a lot of new updates and ways to make you play more. 6. The game itself is very fun and challenging. It is hard but in a satisfyingly way. 7. Worth the money. You get 2 copies of the game + the Reign Of Giants DLC basically included. 8. Good combat mechanics. Not the best but you definitely have to learn how to fight each and every animal/monster. 9. A lot of tactics and strategies so you never get the same experience. 10. A bunch of characters you can choose from and customize as you like. Even more with mods. Every character has a different play style and traits so combined with 9. you basically get A LOT of ways to play the game. 11. A very interesting feeling you get when you play it.",1527283227,True

(I'm gonna stop right there before I get sentimental and stuff) So I would highly recommend this game because of the fun and hype it creates within the player, and the combat is just very good and smooth (depending on your computer). The game doesn't take a good computer to run. A regular, $300 or higher computer would be able to run it on its own. I do not have Don't Starve, the original, but just going to say, if I ever play it, that I will definitely have fun with it.

Now don't f up the following, and down try to substitute anything. Place pork into a Dutch oven with onion and garlic, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat is cooked through, about 2 hours. Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from the chile pods. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups of water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then remove from heat to cool. Transfer the chiles and water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture, stir in salt, and set aside. Shred the cooked meat and mix in one cup of the chile sauce. Soak the corn husks in a bowl of warm water. In a large bowl, beat the lard with a tablespoon of the broth until fluffy. Combine the masa harina, baking powder and salt; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as necessary to form a spongy dough. Spread the dough out over the corn husks to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Place one tablespoon of the meat filling into the center. Fold the sides of the husks in toward the center and place in a steamer. Steam for 1 hour. Remove tamales from husks and drizzle remaining chile sauce over. Top with sour cream.

It's all the unexpected challenges that make this game so fantastic.  You thought you'd make a living farming all that beefalo poop to fertilize your gardens? WELP they just killed you in their rampage when you got too close to them at the wrong time of the year. Thought you'd skirt the hounds to the big mean boss in the area full of lava and collect whatever they drop afterwards? Nice, the boss just killed you. Did you just get your camp all geared up for winter? Oops, there's the lightning and it just lit your whole camp in fire, destroying everything in its wake. Did one of your group members make a hunting camp near a well stocked area full of everything you could hope for to collect? Welp, they didn't think to mention the spiders roaming nearby.  All the while the group of friends you are playing with are laughing at your misfortune.  But despite all of the setbacks that send you scurrying back to the beginning before crushing you as the winter comes rolling around - or perhaps because of them - there's just something about this game that pulls you so deep within it that it is nearly impossible to stop, until you and the group of friends you're playing with are so tired you all have trouble keeping your eyes open and you realise it's 3am and you all should be asleep.",1511437719,True

76561198066939942,"[h1]Backstory of How I Got Into Don't Starve ([u][b]Skip to Next Header To Read Review[/b][/u])[/h1]   Don't Starve was a game that I bought on my birthday back in 2013. I had no idea what to expect from it when I bought it. When I eventually played it I found that I loved the mechanics, the gameplay and the artstyle. Everything about Don't Starve was great!  Then came along the first DLC for the game, Reign of Giants. It was a great addition to the game (even if I was scared to play it due to all of the new bosses.   After Reign of Giants came out I thought to myself, ""Hey, this would be great with multiplayer"". I hoped and prayed that multiplayer would be added to one of my all time favorite games for many months, but on the inside I knew that it never would come out.  When I heard that it did I lit up, I signed up for the beta and watched many youtube videos on it (By the way, I never got into the beta).  The second the game dropped on steam I bought it and sent the extra copy to my friend. We played for many months but eventually stopped playing after we lost a good world. Recently I picked up the game again and my friends and I have been having a blast!  [h1]Review of Don't Starve Together[/h1] [u][b]DISCLAIMER![/b] This Review Was Made On 08/18/2016[/u]  Don't Starve Together is a game all about, well, not starving together... or not buring to death during summer together... or not being eaten by a giant one-eyed bird... or not being mauled to death by a pack of ravenous hounds together... Look you get the point. It's a game all about using teamwork to survive in the evil world that Maxwell has created for Wilson in Don't Starve.  Teamwork can be very helpful but at the same time it can tear you apart. You will eventually run out of food, and when you do, you are bound to turn on your friends and blaim them for ""taking"" the food for themselves.  The gameplay of Don't Starve Together is almost exactly the same as in Don't Strave, except this time around there are new items to use that benefit your friends and yourself in the longrun.   Working as a team in the world of Don't Starve makes the game a hell of a lot easier for you, being able to have one person go out and get berries as you chop down wood greatly increases your chance of survival. The only thing wrong with working together is sharing of resources. This causes you to have to go out and get more food fast so you... Don't Starve. The only way to be sure that you don't fully run out of food is by raising the regrowth rate of plants and by raising the level of berries and carrots that will spawn.  [h1]Summary[/h1] Overall, Don't Starve is a great game for anyone who is looking for a fun yet hard survival game. It is also good for anyone who was a fan of the original Don't Starve.  One key point to note is that, you can play Don't Starve Together alone, making it almost the same as the base game.  It is also important to note that Reign of Giants is free with Don't Starve together. This doesn't mean that you will get if for Don't Starve as well, you'll still have to buy it separately. But honestly who cares, just buy Reign of Giants too. Klei is a great company that makes great games, so why not support them in any way possible.  I give Don't Starve Together a 10/10. It is a perfect game that deserves the overwhelmingly positive reviews that it is getting.  [h1][b]IMPORTANT FUTURE NOTE FOR DON'T STARVE TOGETHER![/b][/h1]  The Shipwrecked DLC that was released for Don't Starve is not currently part of Don't Starve Together but it most likely will be in the next few months (or at least by 2017 hopefully).  It is also important to note that all future DLC for Don't Starve will not be available for Don't Starve Together until months after it is released for Don't Starve. [b]So if they release a DLC for Don't Starve that adds more pets and monsters in the month of March, don't expect it to come out until around October of the same year for Don't Starve Together.[/b]",1471543849,True

76561197969385956,"There are times I'm loving this game and there are times I'm groaning in boredom or frustration with this game. It takes a game or two to grasp the basics. Once you get the idea down though it's a fairly easy [strike]to play[/strike] to know what to do.  Find food. Find rocks. Find wood. Make tools. Build a camp site.   After that?  Explore. Advance your camp site with things you find. Find or build additional methods of gathering food. Build things to defend yuorself with when fights happen.  The problem with this game mostly comes with death. When you die you turn into a ghost and watch as your body poofs into a skeleton and drops your intire inventory on the ground for you to fetch when you return alive. The long trip back to the spawn tends to be the largest issue for me. If you went miles out to explore new area you have to walk - as a ghost - miles back to the spawn where you started the game. There you resurect in a new body, and then you walk miles back to the place you died and collect your old inventory - stopping for nights of course since travel during night kills you (again). And then miles back to get home again - with night as downtime again. Death is [b]expensive[/b] in terms of time.  If you happened to die in Winter you'll never make it back to camp since you don't come back to life with a thermal stone (an item that keeps you from freezing to death during Winter). And you can't make a thermal stone on the spot. You need ingredients for it. Which you don't start with. you have no time to get these ingredients either since you start freezing only five steps into the cold. Unless you built your camp right at the spawn or you had the foresight to set up a stone-liked campfire and some wood (and possibly a thermal stone) at the spawn you're likely perminantly dead if you die in Winter.  Death is unforgiving as well. each time you die your max HP lowers. Why they thoguht that was a good idea baffles me. If you couldn't survive with 150 HP you know you won't survive with a max HP of 30 (about 2 hits if you wear armor). This isn't unfixable. You can craft booster shots that refill the max little by little. But you have to get the ingredients for these from monsters which have a possibility of lowering your max HP further.  But I have a theory that making death so harsh makes you as a player strongly favor survival over taking a chance. And it brings players to strongly desire working as a team over being greedy by knowing you'll need the help of others to safely build booster shots and help when death becomes imminent. I won't lie though; the times I have to spend 11 minutes over a corpse run are times I start thinking it'd be more fun to play something else.  The best part of the game is when you start putting together a pretty awesome camp. The feeling of accomplishment is powerful. Having nearby allies against attacks, a reliable food source, a stockpile of tools and replacements, and pure desire to see what else is out there with your friend(s).  The art style of the game originally threw me. I probably would have tried it sooner than I did if it didn't have the clunky paper drawing look. But after actually trying the game it struck me kinda cute and quirky. the characters to choose from leave me wondering if they were programmed correctly though. One says they're comfortable in darkness but their sainity drops like any of the others does soon as night time pops.  I can't help but feel the downsides of this game will be fixed up in time.

I've bought the game numerous times as gifts for other people, including my own daughter (we even did a version of Hard Knock Life (It's a Don't Starve Life) about the game. I rarely if ever buy a game more than once and for more than one console, unless I LOVE a game. I dare say I will still be playing this game when I'm a dottering old grandmother. Telling my grand kids..now THIS..this is how you make a good game. Watch and learn kids..watch and learn.  Highly recommended!",1484599745,True

76561197994613719,As someone who hasn't played the single player version that much I still wholeheartedly recommend this game.   You are going to get the most out of it with at least three friends. Talking and planning is essential here – maybe you will see your buddies in a new light after a few hours of a desperate battle against the many odds the game throws against you.   Beware: human emotions tend to go haywire in dangerous situations. You'll know what I mean if you ever built – what you thought was – a reasonably stable ecosystem only to completely be bamboozled by some irresponsible action of a friend.  Life will be tough but it's addicting. Especially together!  + realistic simulation of being lost in the wildernis with your friends. (=you die) + lovely graphics + the well goes deep: there's much to explore + endless replayability + intuitive gameplay (this one's a must) + stuff gets patched and refined regularly + you can burn forests!  - main menu is a bit confusing to use with the controller - you may lose a friend or two - you can burn your camp  Nomitated this game for the “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.,1477409146,True

76561198061597401,"Hiya, today im giving a review on the game, Don't Starve Together. This game has its pros and cons of course, like any other game I will honestly rate it!  Don't Starve Together is a game currently in Beta made off the game Don't Starve, you must survival the dark and twisted world. Weird giants and creatures all around, harsh weather conditions, the horrid wave of hounds you always forget about until you see the words, ""The hounds are baying!"" This game is definitly a game you want to try with friends or maybe on your own, you work together or not, and attempt survival. It is difficult at first to be honest, but as the game goes on it gets alot better :)  Pros~ Character Variety(Workshop Aswell) Art style Voices are instruments Never ending Laughs and scares for all X3 A fun coop game  Cons~ Can be very difficult at times Hackers do exist Furries on Workshop Everything will kill  To sum up the game, I'd give it a 9/10, I play it with my friend Tori all the time and it's always fun, never ever do we get tired of playing it. We suck so we usually cheat. I don't like the hounds but you can turn them off, now they have gifts :D And the game gets better and better after each update :)  Buy it even if it isn't on sale, I bought the 4 pack and gave some to friends to play. You won't regret this purchase at all :)",1452933159,True

76561198037044417,"A little weird to me that you either wait for the launch of this game to get don't starve together, or get a free copy of it at launch when you own the game. These games typically are a bit weird because you never get an unfinished copy of it until it's done. However it is a quirky little fun game that's 2D. Typical old school point and click type game for movement where you point and click on floor. Movement is a weird because of the graphics and the character gets stuck or has problems moving around things at times in order to pick things up. Could use more work. The devs actually put out updates and fix things. They have been timely with caring and tending for their game. This is your typical survival game. You can actually beat it in adventure mode but it is very short and not much gameplay is offered there.   You can build but it is very limitted. No roof's or shelters for you either. You can make things like umbrellas but you will never have true shelter other than building a fence. The fences are not durable and there are no gates available. It's a chore constantly breaking things to get in and out of your fenced area. Storage isn't good. Crafting storage takes a lot of wood and offers very little space. You end up crafting 30 or more just to keep your things stored. You can't really build too much and you can't rely on farming because in the winter nothing grows. You can survive from animals you hunt or stored rabits as well as other things here and there like birds. Provided, that you prepared and stocked up on items to survive. The game offers seasons which may or may not make things a tad more difficult due to weather changing.   Food will spoil quickly even in a craftable ice box. I suggest storing rabits with traps you made to catch them in storage chests so you can avoid the spoiling of food through the winter. Each storage chest can hold up to only 9 items. The idea is get what you can and survive while preparing for winter. Collect and gather resources and craft items to survive or play adventure mode and survive. At night if no light is made by you, you will die and just about anything else can kill you as well. Fun for a few hours but not enough to keep you busy for months. I pop in and out of it as new things become available.   Several mods for this edition of the game as well as the original version of the game. Recommended for short gaming sessions for those who want a much easier and funnier survival game. There are ways to avoid death by crafting armor or touching a touching stone or getting supplies to make magic items non stop that can aid you to stay alive. But if not prepapered you will die and have to restart your game again as there is perma death. However in this version of the game you can come back to life if you have your settings set for that.   This version is almost the same as the original version of the game but allows for playing with other people you pick or with randoms. You can very easily play with other people with little to no hassle or set up on your end. You do not need to deal with port forwarding settings which makes this co-op experience more attractive to newbies. Their wiki for the game is a bit weird to use and no search bar is even provided so I suggest just reading forums or talking with their community for help or ideas. Although it is not really needed as they game shows you what you can and can not craft. Making it so much easier rather than playing a survival game where you have to be glued to a wiki page because the game failed at teaching you anything or showing you what you could and couldn't do. I am really liking the games that clearly show you what is going on and what you can make. Enjoy! :)",1420995362,True

As much as you want to be able to explore and do your own thing each day in game you find that you are in essense just ruled by the clock. There is always stuff that has to be done each day and there simply isn't enough time to get it all done even with extra people helping. There is a constant pressure of everything being required to prevent death.  - Need wood constantly because if you are in darkness at night you die. But of course you can't just go out and chop wood all day cause it pisses off the tree guardian then you've gotta spend a bunch of time dealing with that guy. - Need to gather or work on growing/cooking food because without food you'll die and pretty fast. And you've got to cook the food or you get nearly nothing for sustanance from eating it. - Need to search for other resources constantly to build weapons and gear that help ease the burden of your daily tasks. And protect yourself from the elements. Also your tools break so fast that 30% of what you gather goes towards the cost of crafting the items you need for gathering. - Need a stock of weapons and armor (which wear out really fast) because every few days the hounds attack or some other monster. - Have to go out and keep the local spider nests oppressed regularly because if you don't a spider queen will spawn and basically just kill you with ease then next time you try to go get some webs. - Need to also gather matierals for warm clothes and a stock pile of food in time for winter because you can't venture out too far or you will freeze to death unless you have warm cloths or warm rocks (that need to be recharged and replaced regularly). - Need to constantly monitor your sanity. Can't explore too much or see too much action in a short time and you have to sleep enough each day because if you don't you go insane. The only cure is taking a bunch of time to pick flowers, find and eat mushrooms...etc essentially wasting a bunch of time that you don't have cause winter is coming FAST!  ...and the list goes on. You are constantly under the gun of having to get 24 hours of crap done in 12 and just when you think you're ahead the game throws you a curve ball that completely ruins ya. After a while it just started feeling like work to me and the game was stressing me out more than it was entertaining me.  Yes there are lots of mods that allow you to control these aspects but I find that you really need to spend some time finding a good balance because when you stop all the need for the plate spinning you realize how dull the game actually is. The constant plate spinning distracts you from realizing there really isn't anything all that engaging on fun going on in the game - there's no story line or end game and once you've gone through the whole cycle of a year and explored the varied biomes there really isn't anything new to see.",1502865433,False

Make sure to cut the trees with two branches at the top. -Be careful on what character you choose as they all have flaws but the best to start with is Wilson. -Always have some extra food on you. You'll never know when someone desperatly needs food. -Green Mushrooms are very good if you are low on sanity. Make sure too cook them though! -The best area to put a base in is near Beefalo  and a road for quick travel. -You do not have to fight spiders to get their silk/glands. Simply lure them into a trap and you get the resources trouble free! -Another say way of getting meat is by going near Moles, putting rocks/flint on the floor and waiting til they go out. Then attack them and you get a morsel without risk! -Treeguards can be be calmed by planting saplings of their trees near them. -Be careful when choosing Webber, as pigs will attack you on sight and you have lower sanity.

I never would've imagined its [i]Minecraft[/i]-like survival mechanics could actually improve with friends and family. [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] proves it does.  My wife and I were both big [i]Don't Starve[/i] fans by ourselves and [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] gave us the chance to thrive or die as one couple against the world. Like a real marriage, but with lots of weird, moody pets and no life insurance. It was love at first sight and our favorite multiplayer experience so far.  It includes all of the original game's DLC (except [i]Shipwrecked[/i], but similar seafaring mechanics have been implemented recently). That means all the crafting, the fighting and the conflict is here, only now it's a shared experience. Play with friends in your local network or against Steam members from all over the world. If you want, you can still play alone as well, but why would you? Seasonal and special events like [i]The Forge[/i] and [i]The Gorge[/i] are better enjoyed with people you know. It's also great to see what combination of characters you and your friends will pick to play together. Who will go for the legacy group (Wilson, Willow, Maxwell...) and who will pick one of the newbies (Wortox, Wormwood, Wurt...)?  While Klei didn't get around to making achievements for it, which I would've liked, they've managed to get me addicted with the game's skin drops. Collecting clothes, trading them, weaving them from discarded items and personalizing my character suddenly became just as important as keeping it alive.  Need another reason to play [i]Don't Starve Together[/i]? When you buy one, you get a free copy for a friend! Even better, if you owned the original before [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] was released, like I did, you may already own it for free!

76561198042765226,"The following is just a quick overview of the game for a full review check out my website at http://ausiejamster.wix.com/ausiesgamingzone#!dont-starve-together/ccpz  Don't Starve Together is a Co-Op/PvP survival game with the ability to be online or off. It is a multi-player remake of the original 'Don't Starve' game. Featuring most of the original content and characters, yet it doesn't include caves as well as the Reign of Giants downloadable content that the original 'Don't Starve' offers. Don't Starve Together is exclusive available on PC and purchasable from the steam store. I think the game's graphics are very good, I love the art-style and the polished content. The audio soundtracks are pretty decent, but aren't really to my style, although, it does suit the art-style of the game. The SFX, however, are amazing for the art-style, showing game designers that reaching out of the main stream sounds can still set a pretty decent scene, while adding to the player experience. It doesn't really have a story, however, you can easily extend the story from the original 'Don't Starve' Game. The game's content however doesn't have a massive downfall because of the lack of story as Klei Entertainment continuously update the game showing they do really care about it. The controls are pretty straight forward and decent with enough buttons to do what you want to do without having to try too hard, making the game easy to pick up. The difficulty of the game, I think is very solid not to hard but also not to easy, giving the game a lot of play time. There is some strategy to the game allowing the player to select the way they would like to produce their living essentials and whether it is stable in all seasons. There is no competitive side on this game at the moment, although, this might change in the future as Klei Entertainment is playing around with the PvP content. Overall I would give the game a score of 8.5/10 I do really think this game can have a lot of success in the future (as it is still in early access).",1426824872,True

I have a strategy for bases, though-  Like, I recommend you find the following three things -Beefalo, for manure and fur. also horns and meat. -Spiders, for silk. Monster meat can also be useful -Gold rocks/boulders. What more can I say? You need gold for a LOT of things.  I say, you should get this game, at least if it's your type of thing.

I think there could be something like a, ""reignition""or something like that. This could be an event where Battlemaster Pugna could return to the battleground.

76561198047832583,"The single player Don't Starve became stale for me after about 50 hours, so I was very excited when DST was released.   It is an unforgiving survival game, with unique mechanics (such as weather and sanity levels) that keep me busy even at 150 hours of gameplay.  The developers keep updating the game and there is so much content now with the addition of the cave system and Reign of Giants.   It is very funny too at times, like when your friend dies in a silly way or when friends don't appreciate how dangerous a fire staff can be and wave it around camp almost burning the whole place down twice.

I more than recommend playing with others you know, because if game-anonymity has taught me anything, it can be a mixed bag with regards to who you'll be playing with.  With this, now you can laugh, cry, and otherwise have a few buddies experience the same things you do.  That being said, I'm using my previous review:  ---  Don't Starve and Dwarf Fortress share one thing in common; losing is fun!  The game itself is a huge learning experience, and you'll always get further (usually) the last time than you did the first time.  Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.  It's brutal at first glance, but even after you get better; the game doesn't stop getting harder.  If anything, the longer you live, the more merciless nature itself gets.

76561198025582767,"The game is fine, if you want to play on dedicated servers, but if you were planning on just playing a hosted game with your friends, the game has serious technical problems that seriously impact its playability, especially long term. There are serious and inexplicable problems with graphical and server lag that have not been adequately addressed by the developer, more than a year after launch. Bugs abound with display options. The longer you play, the more likely these fun sucking bugs will arise, and the more serious their impact can become.  I get that Klei is working on these issues, but some of these issues have been around since the Beta. It's beginning to look like they simply aren't able to resolve them, either through a lack of technical expertise or simply the limitations of their implementation. This is a terrible shame, because the game, when it's playable, is very enjoyable, but the fruits of your labor (sustained survival) is punished by unbearable lag and unexplanable choppy frame rates.  Add in that the developers have made needless changes to characters and items from Don't Starve (such as major nerfs to characters and inexplicably adding durability mechanics to the Thermal Stone), the use of mods, even unstable and incomplete versions, is necessary to restore Don't Starve Together to Don't Starve multiplayer, as it was originally marketed.  Lucky for me, I got DST free, since I owned Don't Starve before DST was released. Had I known when I bought it what I know now, I probably wouldn't have bought Don't Starve Together for my friend, however.  Buyer beware.  TLDR: It's fun. It's addictive. It's a hot mess of 2 year old bugs. Last two days, I've spent more time researching how to deal with the fun sucking lag than actually enjoying the game. If Klei can resolve the lag issues for Hosted games, I'd whole heartedly recommend it. As it is? Can't do it.  PS - Before you leave a typical stupid comment about my machine... The game ""lags"" while my computer is only at 60% RAM resources and 40% processor usage, and this is with browsers, Discord, AV running on Windows 10. My computer can run MUCH more resource intensive games (like WatchDogs, Guild Wars 2, and Saints Row III and IV) on maximum settings. It isn't my PC. There's some kind of memory leak. I found that logging out of Windows, then logging back in restores smooth gameplay, despite the large number of beasties and other junk spawned in the world, even, again, while running browsers, Discord, and AV on Windows 10.  It's good/bad. If you don't mind frequent reboots/relogs on Windows, it's fine.  PPS - Overall, the game is fun. It's addictive, though it eventually runs its course, but all games do. There are many worse games to spend $15 on. Sadly, however, it's very hard to find anyone that actually plays it vanilla (without mods), because the game, as it's put together, is frustrating and designed to basically to kill you. Unmodded, this punishes long term play on established servers (that and the sheer number of monsters would crash most servers within weeks, if not days). Recommended? Yes. With caveats.

Nice enough, with different graphics and be good enough to reflect the atmosphere of the game in my eyes +1 launches add points.The game is not 2D.We can't say that is actually fully 3D.So like 2.5 D. As a result, it perfectly suits a game like this the graphics.  Gameplay- At first I thought it would be less of the content.Then when you craft something,do new things, they do thrive as it evolves and you want to make it better.The control system is quite simple; Motion and interference. but it's good enough for this game.As for the crafting system... The crafting system in this game is really burdensome to you to explain it a little by trying to find out more fun for you and is curious. Co-Op- Together with your friends and if you have enough of your friends if it is ok. Track of time I'll tell you that we passed.

76561197963203759,"One of my most favourite games of all time. A fantastic survival challenge game that I return to again and again because of the depth and variety of gameplay mechanics. There is enough depth to the game that you can adopt a variety of different playstyles to succeed at the same tasks; you aren't chained to any one strategy (or the same way everyone else does) to get shit done.  Don't Starve rewards the player's experience level and ability to strategize and innovate/come up with new tactics. Like TFC, the longer you play the game, the more tidbits of knowledge you accrue, and the more u can combine that info to exploit a game system in a newer, more clever/efficient manner, which is awesome!  The first few hundred hours will be spent learning the game and how to survive. Once you have the basics down, there's whole worlds (Overworld and Underworld) of different challenges you can tackle. If you have the imagination, creativity and drive, the end game can consist of countless hours designing and constructing your own custom base, as beautiful or efficient as you'd like it to be.  Don't Starve Together allows you to do this with the benefit (or curse) of playing this game with friends or strangers, in a variety of manners (casually, co-op challenge, or pvp) which only adds to the already insane base of replayability options that Don't Starve already offers.  The fact that Klei (so far) has proven to be a solid indie studio with integrity, and a proven track record of fun, well-designed games with good production quality, along with their decision to maintain and build on their game by putting out a constant stream of content in various updates has only served to continue to breathe new life into this game and keep Don't Starve Together as a constantly fresh & fun gameplay experience.  So far Klei has been my best experience with a video game studio (which is saying a lot. I've had some pretty BAAAD ones in my time), so my sincere hope is that they'll not grow too big, too fast, and be able to continue to treat their community well and reward them with a continual stream of fresh, quality content and games.

But at some point a griefer came in, waited till the night is several seconds to end, and set everything on fire, the base, forest, everything (and, additionally, summoned a lot of tentacles on the base, but whatever). People voted to restore previous save, but it didn't help since the saves are made simply at start of the day. We've just saved! We tried loading it again but it's the same save, the same day, and it's not possible to choose day. So the game is corrupted. Anti-griefer system doesn't work. We've got our world broken by a griefer, forever. We started a new world, survived 15 days, and the same guy (with different nickname) joined. And did the same exact thing again, when night is almost ended... He has set everything on fire, and summoned tentacles, again. Another corrupted world, again. What do we do? He outsmarted your simple anti-grief system. My suggestion here - to be able to choose how far you want to rollback.  P.S.

From me not understanding how to find flint to being chased from the Ent like tree monsters all the way to freaking out yelling when the atomsphere before the hounds came ( [strike] I haven't died to bees yet I dont see the big deal [/strike] ) my gaming experiance has been a great joy. I even went to purchase the single player editon and all the DLC in hopes to get a better understanding and beat my record of surviving 15 days (God this guy is such a noob!)   10/10 I would recommend this!

76561198122541900,"A truely amazing sandbox/survival game. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. Even though I have not played the original Dont Stave I found that it did not present a steep learning curve however one may want to refer to game guides if you are not familiar with survival based games or when one reaches the more advanced sections in the game such as the winter or crafting  complicated items.   Not only is it a constant battle for food, you will need to keep yourself sane as you battle against the elements, fight the savage wilderness and strange creatures that roam the land. Stay out of the dark as Charlie haunts the pitch shroud  at night and one would need to be strategic while preparing for the winter as it only gets tougher to survive. The experience and atmostsphere is only enhanced by the drawn style graphics which closely resemble the works of Tim Burton (Creator of The Nightmare Before Christmas and other movie titles.).  One could say that there are elements present that are Minecraft inspired however stating that this game is anything close to Minecraft would be completely incorrect as I believe this game is very original in it's own right.  Second of all this game offers so much fun and stability for an early access game it is defintely worth it. To be entirely honest this game does not feel like an early access beta at all. Very little lag is experienced during gameplay, it is well optimized for a beta version and I have not experienced any game breaking bugs nor have I encountered a single game crash as of yet.  Pros: + Runs like a beauty (No need for a beefy computer). + Huge replayability (With the addition of mods to make it even more interesting or challenging.) + Many customizable options for maps (Amount of resources, enemies, size, etc.). + Creating servers is simple and quick. + Simple controls.  Cons: + When hosting a sever with 6 or more players the game tends to lag slightly. (A dedicated server will probably fix this issue.) + No in-game tutorial for the begginers to DST who have not played the orignal DS.   Unfortunately controller / gamepad is still not available to use in this DST however I cannot classify this as a con as it is a matter of preference wether you prefer to play with a key board and mouse or a gamepad however if you prefer a gamepad then this would be a con.  On a final note there is nothing more satisfying than playing this game with a couple of friends, I have found this game to be truely rewarding and can be enjoyed for hours.   I am extremely happy with the money I have spent and would recommend this anyone looking for a co-op survival game.",1420245075,True

76561198186144443,"Overall a nice endless survival game I fell in love with right off the bat. An utterly amazing draft, stunning graphics, inscrutable mechanisms, challenging seasons, perfect crafting and balanced items, which are not exceedingly overpowered nor good-for-nothing.  Every world is randomly generated making each save original, generally urging to explore new biomes, enemies, plants and so on.  It does not go without saying that such a venerable looking game tries to bring you to knees at any circumstances. It may sound hilarious at first, yet come think of it all the insidious traps, hideous bosses and even the environmental mechanics make your game experience utterly unbearable. Even though the game name might seem to introduce you to the main problem, in the end, starvation is the last thing to kill you.  It might look like a very onerous trifle from the get-go, but do not hesitate to keep trying, because you will eventually favour and adore this game in the very end. From that being said, it is crucial to realize that this (together) edition was made to be played with 1-5 additional players, and is therefore composed for multiplayer experience only. It should be fairly obvious for you, now,  why the pause button does not actually seem to be working even when playing as a host on your own without anyone else. For singleplayer experience, seek the original (non-together) edition, which is easier and more balanced for only one player.  Keep in mind, that this (together) edition has the Reign of Giants downloadable content permanently toggled on, whereas in the original (non-together) edition can be switched not only between the Reign of Giants but also between Vanilla and Shipwrecked content, which still has not been implemented into this (together) edition.  Last but not least, the community is completely astonishing. New characters, items, dishes, animations; and simply extraordinary mods are created on a pretty much daily basis. Lastly, since 2016, this game has been getting plenty of brand new updates including special events, mechanics, items and bosses.  To cut a long story short, I shall give this game 9.5/10 for not having the same downloadable and workshop content as the (non-together) edition yet.",1456313702,True

76561197975346239,"If you've played the original Don't Starve and have been aching to play it with your friends, or random people, I highly recommend this game. This game is a lot of fun when it's played with friends because you guys get to decide on what type of adventure you guys want to get yourselves into because you can edit the world to your liking. Whether it be a world with scarce resources, monster-filled environments, or with just plain, set-to-default settings, it's still very fun! As a veteran player, I really like jumping into random games people host because I like to ""observe"" what the other veterans do (like hunting Koalefants/Tallbirds for their meats) and what the new players are trying to do (like killing five spiders, two of which are Spider Warriors, with a pickaxe), which, I have to admit, is very entertaining the majority of the time. There are some times, ESPECIALLY when the Winter season comes, where you just wish everyone that joined the game you're in knows what they're doing, or just able to ""pull their weight,"" because of scarce resources (many people make all sorts of personal tools and gear without gathering the materials themselves) and constantly dwindling food supplies (too many mouths to feed and not enough hunters). However, when your whole team DOES manage to make it past the first winter season, it's a very satisfying accomplishment.  If all of what I previously said doesn't sound very appealing to you, then don't bother with the game. Frankly, if you like making a base JUST for YOURSELF, not liking the idea of being with other players, or just being antisocial in general, then you really wouldn't like the multiplayer addition to Don't Starve; this game is meant to be played with other people and working TOGETHER with said people (hence the emphasis on TOGETHER for DST's teaser), so you're seriously better off playing vanilla if you're just going to be antisocial in a social game. I don't want to sound mean, but it's the truth (at least it is for me).  Even though the game is still in its Beta phase, it's very playable; the devs have done a great job so far and the updates just keep rolling in with fixes. Get it if you really want it, but if you can wait, then I recommend waiting for its official multiplayer release (around summer), of which is included (I THINK) in the original Don't Starve.",1422349616,True

Cons: *Can get kinda laggy (and thus, frustrating) if you're playing as a guest and your connection (or the host's one) is not the best. *Better with friends for most people. *The game COULD overwhelm you at the start since it's got many items, crafting recipes and etc.  And I can't think of other cons!

Every aspect of combat is swing, back away, swing, back away, you never really have much sense of progression as you play, as in, you could play for a week straight have every item and be master of your domain, but yet you still gain little to no advantage in combat and so the enemies never become a fair fight.

It has artistic elements reminicent of Tim Burton's style; rough pen designs, a dark and limited color palette, with odd and disproportionate bodies, characters and monsters, which work to set the tone. Unfortunately some of the art assets don't scale well on higher resolutions, perhaps a redux or texture rework would improve such, although this contributes to the fact that it works pretty well on most machines regardless of specification, even providing a netbook mode for such hardware.  There are many elements to the survival, producing a somewhat steep learning curve.

You go around places, harvest things to help you build tools to survive, or grab a weapon and start hacking away at animals for food ( or grow your own veggies and cook them in a crockpot ).   The fact that this game allows modding is perfect, because it allows you to play a wider cast of characters this way, and lets you bring in certain mechanics and items that the game alone doesn't offer.

It is too difficult for a person who has no experience with coding, and I will probably never be able to make one, but that is alright because there are many creators out there who like to do so anyways!

Well, it's a very different survival game, great art design, great multiplayer, tradable items, you can play this game on single player mode with no problems, good lore, awesome characters, awesome boss fights, awesome items, you can run this game on a potato, but like all games, Don't Starve Together have some issues, most of them are related to the community and not the game it self.   Well one of the bigest issues is that most of the players are stupid noobs, and it seems that they never learn how to play, they're stuck in this infinte stupid noob loop, always making the same stupid mistakes and never learning anything from them. The other issue is the stupid workshop mods, most of them are stupid mods that makes the game very easy or its a stupid anime character mod. When you are going to play in a stupid public server, people use a stupid list of 99999999999999 stupid mods that make the gamer easy and adds a lot of stupid anime characters.

Simple mechanics  Cons: Battle mechanics a bit oversimplistic The game punishes you for your mistakes (not necessarily bad, but I imagine new players have a hard time adapting) Could have a bit of a story to it, so you have a quest and not just strivig to survive  My wishes (improvements I guess) Adding even more to multiplayer what is already available in single player (like they did with caves and Reign of Giants DLC, which is DST is based on). What I mean by this is add more levels to the caves, have a chance to randomly find a pirate ship on the map which would then transport you to the Shipwrecked world (kind of like caves work).

I can't be sure which items, characters, and enemies have been added since the original release of Dosn't Starve, as I like to discover these in-game rather than read about them online. I feel safe to assume that the cartographer's desk only became useful with the addition of multiplayer. Map creation appears to allow the choice between classic Don't Starve and the new additions of Don't Starve Together.  I recieved this version free because I already owned the base game.

After I figured out how to cut trees and build a base, a magnificient, huge and friendly Deerclops poped-up out of nowhere... Don't worry, we had a great time around my campfire(or what was left of that campfire) and we played hide and seek all the night. He managed to find me in every corner of the map; it was fun, though, it was like I had a second Chester but a little bit bigger. Me and my friends had great time in this game. I like how every creature in this game automatically dislikes you and wants to kill you or steal from you(I look at you, Cave monkeys and Krampusse!). I think some of them are a little too overpowered(Dragonfly, Toadstool, Bee Queen) but that's the fun of the game. I highly recommend this game because you learn what really teamwork is and you don't need a high-end pc to run it. I have a ten years old pc and this game never crashed or stayed below 50 fps.

76561198112375009,"Don't Starve Together is a potentially wonderful game with an inventive art style and simplistic motives. It has a relatively interesting take to keep yourself invested. The main idea is to run around gathering resources and fending for oneself with whatever your main character has.  It's generally a struggle at the start, but with teamwork it can alter a bit to be easy. Or if you know what the hell you're doing by yourself to begin with and didn't just jump in to be breast fed by a pro player it could be easy too... But I digress!    I would recommend it months ago when I had first gotten into it, but as of lately, I've gotten a tiny bit apprehensive to the newest changes to the game. Not because it is a struggle to play said game. On the very contrary! It's mostly how easy it is.    I'll list the changes that have made the most impact to the gameplay for myself. I am going over what made the strongest impact, and not the full thing. I may add later, but for now, it'll be limited:   >Haunting Destruction Removed:    At first, the most understandable change that had occurred were stopping the rapid fires in Don't Starve Together. I am not saying bring back the fires. No one wants a raging loon taking revenge for not housing them by dying and then setting fire to the world. That's no good. It can ruin someone's gameplay at times, which is understandable. But I'd like to bring a point across. To others, this is a bit upsetting and made the gameplay seem not worth the try, but to myself, it added to my own interest.  I liked the _unexpected_ challenge I had. It made me prepare for the problem prior, and made myself feel a little bit challenged after I've understood the way to handle the mess from replay of said experience. And if you want replay, you want challenges and unfortunately, a chaotic unexpected player is a challenge. It made the community more interesting and had grabbed me to help out after an incident occur. Without them, I don't feel so inclined.   >Caves    Caves are great. Caves are always a challenge to work through and live in. Everything in them is basically a ticking time bomb. If I had to say anything of said game aspect, it'd be for more of this. Not enough players go underground and you can avoid it if you really want to, so it can be a bit of a bore by yourself. But the importance is that the caves work. I want more troubles you can't account for. More ways to survive and not survive all wrapped in one. I don't want my adventure to be easy. I want it to be fun.   >Touch Stone Regeneration   Originally, Touch Stones were a one time use. If you used it once, you better make it worth it, especially in Survival. Now, it makes any challenges in Don't Starve Together boring. Everyone lives near the touch stone now. It makes the challenge nonexistent unless you happen to die in a far location, but if you live near your resource to reviving, nine out of the ten times you're going to make the walk to it because you're glued to the spot you live in.  Now I can hear it, don't live near it, but eh, I want to play Don't Starve Together with strangers and have fun. I can't have fun if we're doing the same boring method after the same boring method.   So in conclusion, what I really want this game to do is expand on ways to struggle in game. Make me say, ""man, I am not going to last at this rate!"" instead of, ""I wonder how else this is going to be too easy in the future."" I like some changes here and there. It makes it interesting. As long as it is a challenge that feels like one. If I can walk away and not become involved in a problem, it can be a bit boring.      ",1478231849,True
76561198253803400,"Don't starve already turned out to become one of my most well-loved games and Don't Starve together just took that love to a whole new level. The game sat on my wishlist and inventory for a long time due to a lack of people to play it with. Tonight, however, I was able to finally give it a shot and all I can say is that I absolutely loved it. I even love it more than the original. While both games are beautifully crafted with magnificent art and clever mechanics, the challenging aspects of Don't starve that everyone falls in love with just gets better and more enjoyable when you have someone to do it with.  Just as being alone in the woods for the original can cause serious ramifications on your sanity and can be considered a very unique metaphor for real life and its loneliness, Don't Starve Together just proves that some things are better together! The woods seem less lonely, the tasks are more manageable and of course, survival becomes monumentally more natural.

76561198243602898,"One of the best games I ever played. 9/10  The game itself has a challenging yet adequate learning curve and plenty of content to discover. Overall the community is friendly and inclusive, definitely best played with friends.  The first few games feel like everything is out to kill you (because it is), and you get a nice adrenaline kick just from frantically trying to survive and loads of laughs as you die in the most unimaginable ways. As you get more experienced and basic survival is no longer a challenge (took me about 30 hours for the novelty of survival to wear off), you'll start planning a bit further and preparing for each season's harsh climate conditions and bosses.   This is when the real game starts and the importance of long term planning, working well with others and managing time and resources effectively become more obvious. It's no longer a matter of surviving, it's a matter of doing it in the most ingenious way possible by combining and interacting the different elements of the game.   e.g.: Frog rain in spring? Certain death for some, free food for others.  Even when you are familiar with the above ground map's climate conditions, biomes, mobs and resources, there is still a lower level (Caves) to explore, which adds an extra layer of complexity and adventure to the game.   As if these incredibly addictive and time consuming aspects of the game weren't enough, there's yet another level which I am just starting to explore which are the Ruins of which I've only seen a couple of mobs and resources despite having played for over 200 hours.  The only thing that I believe can be improved (hence the 9/10 rating) is that other than autumn, all other seasons can be quite un-welcoming to both new and experienced players alike, so you're much more likely to (be left to) die when joining a server during winter or summer.  My favourite aspect of DST, is that it delivers these challenging mechanics and interactions through hilarious visuals and dark sarcasm, which will inevitably make you laugh even in the most difficult situations.",1477668360,True

76561198311993104,"Don't Starve Together is a really great game, it's like Don't Starve all over again, but this time with friends!  You may think playing with friends is easier, but it makes everything so much harder! Firstly, you need more food to feed yourselves. Secondly, people may (sometimes) want to PvP, even in other servers, like what happened to me...I died because they saw that I was a noob and decided to kill me multiple times for fun. Thirdly (the worst), because you may be playing with friends, the monsters' health are increased drastically! EVEN if you are playing single player mode! This makes the game all the more difficult, and fun for you and your friends, and is also a great test of your teamwork, patience, and your friendships >:D  However, they decided to make other aspects of the game easier and more fun: -You can play ANY character, even Maxwell from the beginning! (Don't Starve needed you to unlock each character by earning enough EXP, which takes a TON of time) -There are new items and other stuff which are not available in DS -Multiplayer! (duh) More people means more challenges, and more challenges means more fun! (and raging) -Fun and challenging events such as The Forge, The Gorge, Year of the (Insert creature here) and lots more will keep you from getting bored and leave you with fresh challenges all-year-round!  This game can kill hours upon hours. As you play, the seasons will change, bringing you new challenges everytime, which may even kill inexperienced players (like me).However, with enough practice, you can surely master the game, and even go beyond just surviving, thriving! Just don't get cocky, even experienced players may screw up some time or another.  Lastly, purchasing this game will include another complementory copy, which can then be gifted to your friend, so they can play with you as well!  Overall, this game is REALLY worth the time and money, and can even keep you hooked for years!

Also lag issues most reviews mention are relics from last year and have been fixed.  I've been playing Don't Starve Together with my best friend in the US (I'm in AUS) for a few weeks now. We had played it about a year ago for a week or two as well.   1.) Content seems to encompass all of the vanilla game + the vast majority of RoG expansion, but does not include SW.  2.) I find with one other person the challenge is about identical or slightly harder than the single player experience.  3.) He hosts the server in US and I connect from AUS. I definitely have lag but rubberband only rarely. The lag is consistent but isn't actually noticeable until you're trying to kite fight monsters, you generally can get one less hit off than if you weren't lagging. The lag is smooth (if that makes sense) and doesn't feel bad (and I usually abhor even minor lag). Compared to a year or so ago rubberbanding is largely gone and lag is less of an issue.  4.) I didn't know dedicated servers were a thing as someone else mentioned in this thread, maybe that would solve the lag issues. Will have to try it out.  5.) Most mods I have tried in singleplayer work with Don't Starve Together as well. We use mostly basic mods like minimaphud, colored wormholes, alwaysshowvalues, etc.  6.) It is definitely a complete, challenging, and highly highly enjoyable game. I personally vastly prefer it to single player (which I love!) even despite my own lag issues.

The multiplayer is my first experience with this game & both the wife & I have spent a lot of time in game yelling, shrieking & laughing our butts off at various things in our attempts to tackle these randomly generated worlds!  EVERY game has been different.  While being wonderful to look at it's very easy to pick up & just start playing.  Fumble your way through the first few days & eventually things start just slotting into place.  Add a few survival  tips from the Don't Starve community & you might make it through the first Winter.  The best part of Don't Starve Together in my opinion are the constant suprises that just keep coming even after 30+ hours playing, whether its environmental, or little interactions between items you had not realised, new mobs or finding out you can feed a pig to make him your little buddy to help chop wood!

You're not only trying to survive but you're trying to beat your own preious goals each time you begin a new server. Every day that passes you and your friends scurry off trying to gather as many supplies for the winter (and days ahead) and hope that your base is in a safe enough spot.   The multiplayer element really makes the game just as enjoyable as the single player version. With friends you're able to set goals and tasks to each person and team up in combats. PVP is a ""hunger games"" like experience. Seeing another player is frightening but an opportunity to team up and take on the server.  Modding for this game is highly accessible and easy to implement. The host of each server controls modding, so whatever mods they have installed, they will be the only ones avalible to use. Un-modded servers are available, however if you havn't played the single player version of Don't Starve I wouldn't recommend joining any un-modded serves. The game requires some getting used to and practice.  As you explore this vast land you'll encounter creatures, friendly beasts, mysterious entities and wonderful and scary abilities of Mother Nature and the human body.

Between its vast majority of places to explore, character variety, and constant additions, the Don't Starve game series is one I'll never get tired of. Every game you join or world you create you discover something new, or are forced to play in a different way to adapt and survive.  Many survival games, once you get the hang of it, it doesn't stay much of a ""survival"" game. But with Don't Starve Together there are many situations that you may not expect to happen that can catch you off guard, such as the newer bosses constantly being added, getting ambushed while exploring the caves, or even just running out of resources forcing you to rely on your wits, instantly putting you back into the game.   The Klei developers themselves are also amazing people, I have seen them time and time again actually talk to those who play the game so people's voices are actually heard, and they are constantly adding new things to the game.

76561198048184220,"Welp, if you played original Don't Starve and have doubts wether or not you should buy this game, you should do it. it's fun, it has public servers so you can jump on other people's games, and if you play with friends it's really fun to have that feeling of surival with them.  But now with the cons. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS EARLY ACCESS AND THIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. But personally, i'm  not really fund of having this sensless survival. like, if you played original Don't Starve, there's at least an objective, something you have to do other than survive. but in this game it's simply...survive, or as the game says, Don't Starve. it might change in the future, but currently it hasn't .  and something that honestly ruins the experience is the whole ghosts thing. basically when other people die they turn into ghosts and even if they're really far away, it will slowly drain your sanity. and this bothers a lot specially in PvP servers. because what's the point of fighting everyone if after they die their ghosts will drain your sanity. so really, this would be a good idea, but only if ghosts are close to you not when they're 1000 miles away. but keep in mind this might be subject to change.  So why give this a good review with this specific cons? because the game's not completely finished. who knows, maybe in the future we will get objectives and the ghosts will be nerfed. but even if that doesn't happen, this game is fun to play from time to time and it can get pretty fun, specially when playing with friends.  as it is right now, I give this game 8/10",1420590673,True

While I think it's more enjoyable to play the co-op version with a friend, it doesn't mean the single player experience isn't worth checking out.  I haven't experienced co-op through the public roulette of open servers -- so I can't speak to the experience of finding a game and playing it that way.  If you do, just know that you'll need a solid chunk of time to devote toward getting futher in the game.

I love sandbox games with survival aspects, I do love 7 days to day, I enjoy Minecraft every now and then, but this game is just special. It is extremely hard at the beginning the game might seem very hard, almost impossible to survive (if you're not going through YouTube tutorials on how to survive, which I strongly recommend - finding everything out on yourself is half of the fun), but later on you'll get a grip of it. You might even survive the winter and then move on.  Now that was the description of classic single player don't starve - this one however's got Reign of Giants included, where spring is making you constantly wet, thus making you go insane, freezing and getting killed by enormous tornado attack ability having gooses... And that's considered a friendly season. It does make the game frustrating from time to time, but it's SO MUCH FUN'  TL;DR: You'll die a lot. You will have to learn a whole lot of things to do, to survive. You WILL die a lot. The game is gonna try to continuously make your life more and more miserable and you sure as hell WILL die a lot.

First and foremost, this game is really fun and enjoyable to play with friends. I remember when my brother showed me the single-player version of the game and I was so amazed. The graphics are very nice and fancy, the music is relaxing and depending on the situation it changes to match the 'background' . If you like survival games to play with friends, I definately recommend this game. On the other hand, once you get familiar with the game it starts to get boring and you can survive indefinately and once you collect most of the resources, build a base, explore the whole map (including caves) there is bassicaly nothing left to do.   Pros: -Really enjoyable with friends -Great music -Many customizations through workshop -Nice gameplay and mechanics Cons: -Poor online servers -Game gets boring after you get good at is since you can survive indefinately -Poor PVP (needs some gamemodes or something) This sums up my review, I hope you found it helpfull! :)  ",1510264158,True

76561198049611738,"Don't Starve was one of my favorite survival games when it came out, and multiplayer has breathed new life into a game I already adored. The addition of extra players, plus tweaking of existing mechanics balanced around multiplayer and an incentive to keep your companions alive, makes the game very fun and leads to a lot of memorable moments, especially with friends (like when they're insane and being attacked by monsters only they can see, and you're chasing them trying to force-feed them jerky to make them regain their sanity and make the monsters stop attacking).  If you enjoyed Don't Starve, and you have friends who also enjoy Don't Starve, this is great fun and I highly recommend it. If you want to play online without friends, do so at your own risk - the community is varied at best.  p.s. Connections can be finnicky at times, but the game is generally quite playable and rubberbanding is very uncommon. There's never any real desyncing issues with the host, and most mods work clientside and won't affect the host.",1433480230,True

It's awesome yet simultaneously annoying; you can bring giants to their knees but still die from a damned frog (if you don't play carefully). So basically it's an amazing game, especially for fans of the wilderness survival and crafting genre looking for unforgiving co-op play.",1471793733,True

The world has seasons and two of the seasons (Spring and Fall) are relatively easy to survive, while the other two seasons are more challenging (Summer and Winter). You need to spend your time wisely in Spring and Fall to make it through Summer and Winter. If you like survival games, you will likely enjoy this one. This game can be challenging at first, but stick with it! It's a lot of fun and its especially fun to play with friends.

76561198167755326,"Well, Don't Starve Together. I love this game, and I don't think I need to point out why, over 30 thousand people have already pointed it out. Impeccable music, unique and incredible art style, brutal yet rewarding gameplay. I have to say, it's hard to stop playing this game, and not in a Skinnerbox method, Candy Crush/WoW kind of ""I can't stop playing."" I'm a total survival + sandbox game junkie, and this fills both of those needs. It's hard for me to name a single problem with this game itself, but I'll get to the problems with it that aren't Klei's fault later on.   ---The Game Itself, and what it's like.--- The game is a blast, full of tough decisions, engaging gameplay, and stress. Lots of stress. Don't Starve Together has you managing a few main things, this being your HP, your Hunger, your Sanity, your temperature, your wetness, and probably most importantly, time. You need to go throughout the world, collecting any resource you can simply to survive. Survive intervals of hound attacks, which get more frequent as time goes on. Survive full moons, where normally friendly pigmen become ...werepigs. Spooky. You'll travel throughout an unforgiving world and eventually set up a camp where you can unlock new recipes to help you survive. Later on, winter will start. In this, plants grow more slowly, days are shorter, nights are longer, and you can very easily freeze.  After a long time, you can improve your base and make surviving ""easier"". It's a grand world of fear and surprises, I'm only scraping the surface.  ---Playing Singleplayer--- Playing singleplayer is great, but if you wanted to do that, Don't Starve is better for it. It's considerably easier, and it even has another gamemode, Don't Starve Shipwrecked that... Well, I'm getting off topic. Singleplayer is great, but it's not where Don't Starve Together is centered.  ><~~~Playing Multiplayer~~~><      Ooh, fancy.  Multiplayer is where Don't Starve Together both shines and falls flat. If you gather some friends and make a private server, it's a total blast! Some of the most fun I've had in a while. Spoiler alert, having food isn't as easy with 6 people. You can survive together, help each other, and if one of you dies, one can revive another for a relatively small price. Truly, in multiplayer, cooperation is key. And that's exactly why public multiplayer is the only real flaw in the game.  The game's community, if you haven't heard about it before, is... Well, it's something else. Over half of the people who play the game are imbecilic and lazy, or just game-ruining for a good laugh. If they don't play well or even decently, they're probably stealing your stuff, destroying your base, or literally just sitting around doing nothing!  True story if you care to listen, actually, I was once in a server that made it until late winter. We even defeated the deerclops, a major boss in Don't Starve. One of the players who lived in our base hadn't really accomplished much. The player that had helped our base grow the most was asking him politely to do something, and he didn't respond. I gave him a golden axe, and asked him to chop some trees for logs. He took it, and did nothing, instead asking for food. The other person started yelling at him to do something. Again, he did absolutely nothing. We ended up kicking him.  It gets MUCH worse than that, however. People just join, ask if they can join your base, or asking for key resources, with varying levels of grammatical errors. If you refuse, they'll give a quick ""f*** u ur a n00b"" and then proceed to either leave, or whine and complain until kicked, or until they inevitably die because they weren't actually playing the game.  ~~~Conclusion/TL;DR~~~ DST is an incredible game blending fun mechanics and stressful decisions. You definitely should buy it if you have friends willing to play with you. If not, then buying the singleplayer Don't Starve would be better... This game isn't worth it for public multiplayer. About 1 in every 6 servers you join will have a decent game waiting for you. Just about everything in the game itself is flawless... If you can take the community.  So, get ready for a fun night with friends. Deal with sanity, monsters, hounds, and especially other players. But most of all... Don't Get Caught Out In The Darkness Without A Torch. Can't wait for that game.",1467467260,True

76561198100680923,"Don't Starve Together is a great survival game, and one of the few games where survival is actually a challenge. This game has a high skill ceiling, and definitely takes time and practice. Playing with a friend will really make the game more fun as well. Now, here are the positives and negatives.  [b] Positives [/b]  -Tons of content -4 Seasons (all have their own content/challenges) -High skill ceiling (very hard and unforgiving) -Many characters with unique personalities and abilities -Skins for customization, plus Ancient King skins (which you need a friend to get them) -Many enemies and creatures, all with unique designs. -Incredible, Tim Burton atmosphere -Caves, which have loads of new stuff including the Ruins. -Sailing on boats, with islands to explore, colonize, etc. -Tons of different types of food to create (via crockpot) -Events such as the Forge and Gorge -Passionate devs who really care about the game.   [b] Negatives [/b]  -Absolutely no tutorial, this game relies on trial-and-error -After a full in-game year, there isn't much to do besides mega-base -DLC Characters. Very few, but definitely don't feel like they belong in this type of game. -Skins are pretty overpriced. On com. market, it's about $1 or less. However, the skins Klei offer are locked behind $3 to $5 prices which I think is overboard. Not much of an issue tho.   To conclude, this game is super fun, especially with friends. I do implore you to find an experienced friend to teach you, or practice a lot. It is hard at the start, and frustrating. You will struggle, that is a given. That is what the game is about, struggling. Keep playing, practicing, and you will only get better. Remember, the important thing to keep in mind is to have fun. Don't cherish your belongings/base, this isn't the type of game for that. You will make new worlds a lot, don't be discouraged. This is normal. Anyways, good luck, and Don't Starve!",1474752683,True

The game's community is very creative and there are hundreds of community-made mods for you to try out and change your experience!

Unlike most other games in this genre, it's not a resource grind--in fact, it requires you to spend your time efficiently and to think ahead to survive.  Survival actually always feels like a threat if you ever stop thinking.  In that sense, can be like a psychological war of attrition (which I love).  Also, I love the atmosphere and the characters: dark, yet whimsical; each demanding a change in your play style as you learn to work with their strengths and weaknesses.  Gets lots of developer love (somewhat to the exclusion of its single-player older brother), even including support for multiplayer using community-created mods and finding other players.

I like how many new things they are trying out with this game, like beefalo taming and riding, clothing to customize characters with, and just the fact that you can survive with others or perish in a land that has overcome you. I can't wait to see what is in the next update because you don't really know what could be done next. But I would say that this game is one of the funnest I've played because every time you load up a new map, it feels like a whole new game because of the randomized generation feature this game has in multiplayer and single player. Then having reign of giants come free with the game makes it even funner to survive, because instead of just summer and winter, there's spring, summer, autumn, and winter to survive through along with the other giants that come as the seasons do.",1453857106,True

76561198163112253,"This is simply the BEST survival game that you will EVER play, with friends or with people online. No other survival game really comes close to matching the aspect of ""surviving"" in DST.  The game is set in a beautiful, dark world where you choose a character with unique abilities to play with. You will begin the game with little to nothing, and you will have to figure out what you have to do to keep your character staying healthy and alive. Darkness, hunger, mobs, insanity, and the wrath that comes with each season of the year will kill you if you’re not careful.  As you learn more about how to survive in the game — through other players, by yourself, or through the helpful Don’t Starve wiki — you will survive more easily, and you will become better equipped to tackle tougher challenges, such as helping to kill big bosses such as Deerclops, or venturing deep down into the Caves to look for greater treasure. You will learn how to be as efficient as possible at base-building, food-making, item-crafting, and resource-collecting. Or, if you are not the efficient-type, you will enjoy wandering around the Don’t Starve world with a Garland on your head, Chester by your side, collecting Berries to eat, and picking flowers along the way. Or, if you just want in-game Skins, you can semi-afk to collect them, which you use to customize your character with, or trade away in the Steam Market for money.  Replayability is wonderful in this game. With every new playthrough, you will challenge yourself to do better than before, and you will encounter new survival techniques. However, you will always be susceptible to dying. Even with the numerous hours of experience that I and other players have, we will still die to unfortunate and/or unforeseen circumstances, and it will be hilarious.  All in all, a fantastic and beautiful multiplayer survival game made by Klei. The developers imbue this game with a lot of heart and love, and they continue to do so with the new events and updates. <3",1483378871,True

76561198111550830," There is Plenty to do in the game, especially when you play with friends. Enough content (and more being added) in the base game, and if you want more, you can change it up how much you want in the workshop by downloading mods for it.  I don't die much unless I'm killed by a random player, but when unlucky events do happen, or when you first start the game (Not used to the gameplay), I'd say this is one of those games with a slight Love/Hate relationship. You die over and over yet you can never hate the game. Not nearly as love/hate-ie as the first game though, Don't Starve, the Single Player Only game, as when you died there, heh, sucks for you!  The game sticks around Multiplayer gameplay, meaning all Boss HP is increased from the first game, as they're meant to have more people beating on them, I've Noticed that hunting rabbits (expecially with traps) makes it to where they don't respawn the next day or sometimes longer meaning that if there's alot of players eating the same food, you'll run out.  Basically, certain things may be more easy when you play alone, but yet when you play with others you'll get further, Because it IS a multiplayer game and that's what they stuck to.  The game isn't very glitchy at all. I have noticed a few here and there, but they're all ""Personal"" glitches as I call them, meaning: Only certain people get them and still have them even after disabling all mods and redownloading the game. (Example: I can't hear certain mobs, I sometimes crash out of the blue, ""Don't Starve Together Has Stopped Responding"")   I wouldn't say that's a problem on the game's part for now, but as some other people have ""Certain glitches"", Maybe not exactly mine, it may be.  Over all, this game is REALLY fun. It's a big step from the Single Player version, and (With the Beta) has pretty cute content c;   Though I would recommend more SMALLER mobs, as not everyone fights those raid bosses. Yes, Baby pets and No-eyed Deer have been added to NR Beta, but there's not alot you can do with those...and rabbits, for example, are getting a bit boring.",1483245137,True

Very helpful and interesting reading material to be found there.  There is a lot to do and learn how to do and even though you may get a bit frustrated with the game from time to time, likely you'll be dragged in to it again just so you can get that little bit better at surviving.

76561198089202086,"Don't starve together (DST) is very good survival game which doesn't need good PC to play. It may be boring for You if you don't have friends to play with, but community is nice so you should find some people to play with. It's like Don't starve (DS) with DLC Reign of giants (RG) but you can play with friends, there are costumes (You get them from presents while playing on server) which you can buy and sell on community market. I will show you cons and pros to buy this game:  +Nice survival game +Low PC requirements +It's DS but with friends  +Mods and costumes +Caves and free DLC (RG)  -Sometimes you can feel bugs -Without gamepad it's hard to play it -After some time it may be boring for some people.

76561198067174849,"This game is amazing!  but I do have so recommendations just to make the game more enjoyable to players who still really like to fight but when they die they don't want to start over.  The newest patch is great where you have the wild mode, but if you want a normal game, that you won't get angry at, you should add in the option to be able to add resurrection to the server you're currently playing in.  I often play alone since I only have one friend, trying to get more but you know I'm p lonely, and when i'm trying to set up my camp and enjoy the game and actually get to explore the entire map which I've never done it would probably be very beneficial to add that feature.

I reccomend this game, but be prepared to die a lot when you first start out and know that you can lose all of your progress at any moment... but that's half of the fun :')   Pros:  - Fun game, you can easily sink many hours into it.  - Very rewarding when you finally get it right and start to build a decent camp, gather supplies and the like.  - Great for playing with friends, or with strangers to create larger settlements and survive. - Lots to discover, I'm still finding new things as I explore.  - Unique, quirky art style.  - Cool monsters.  Cons: - The online multiplayer element of the game means that you cannot pause the game (you have to leave the game and come back, if you leave the keyboard you could lose everything before you get back) and you cannot save file in the traditional sense. This makes dying very frustrating, especially if you were doing well.  - Brutal game, everything wants to kill you and sometimes this gets too much.",1468272430,True

76561197963324072,"Very fun and addictive survival game where you can team up with your friends and try to survive in the wilderness against monsters, hunger, darkness and cold and keep yourself from losing your mind in the process.  Pros: + There is no perfect class. All classes have one or more weakspot aswell as one or more strength that counters another. All depends on your play-style what you want to go with. + I tend to have trouble creating servers and having my friends connect to those but on this game I have seen none of those problems. + Plenty of different game modes to fit to your preferred play-style. + The game rewards you with cosmetic items every once in a while to customise your character. + Countless hours of fun with your friends  Cons: - There seems to be no way of tracking your friends. When you reach a certain distance you lose track of their location. I ran around for ages joining my friend's server trying to find him and his camp until I eventually died in the dark. Add some way of partying up and maybe something that shows in which direction and how far away from you they are. - The game could use a tutorial. If you only just started playing your only help is checking the key-bindings. - Public servers are full of territorial hermits that will guard their camp at every cost and will not take friendly to intruders.

76561198112921462,"Did you guys notice the pun in the game's title? Don't Starve TO GET HER(Charlie) ;)  I've been playing Don't Starve since, about 2014 or 2015, I also recieved the beta version of this for free, and been playing since.  I gotta say, this game takes a really unique style to survival genres! I love the artstyle, the music is pleasant to listen to (besides ragtime, god is that hell to listen to for hours.), the characters are unique and in my view aren't broken in any way. Like you hear from others, it's MUCH more fun playing with friends! I honestly love how the continued the lore from the classic Don't Starve, and made it really interesting. I hope I can see more content in the lore from Klei, as it would be amazing! Anything else added like items would be amazing too.  And that people say that ""this game has no tutorial, therefore I do not reccomend"" or say ""Omg it's soooo hard to survive, such a lame game, it sucks!!11!1!!"" and honestly, don't even review the game if you can't figure out how to play or just look up guides.   Alright, time to get to the Pros and Cons.  Pros +Art Style is unique! +Music is great. +Love the customization in outfits! +It supports mods, to make it fresh. +Fun with friends. +Buying outfits are cheap. +No trolls (that burn bases), atleast for me. +So far, the expierence with support is superb!  Cons -Hard for someone that is new and doesn't know how to play. -The gift boxes for outfits rarely give any good outfits, they should make it so the more you open in a week, the more chances to get really good outfits. -Honestly, it does get a bit tedious after awhile if you can't make it to even summer. -You can't do much more if you can't add caves, which requires much more to run it. (Besides running in singleplayer or something)  (My Personal cons that don't count) =Not really that fun if you're a pro playing with a noob that you have to carry around like an extra bag of stones =Honestly, there are WAY too many people who join my servers and after I make base, they just stay there claiming to be ""taking care of the base"" when they just sit there cooking food in crockpots for no reason, and just eating it all. I know I can ban them and all, but it honestly feels so rude that I don't. =Hell, I haven't even gotten past summer myself! =There are also people who join servers that have a ton of days on, and don't do anything because they like being free fed and doing nothing for it. =Really hard to join servers that are hosted by strangers because I'm shy asf, so I just kinda hover around a bit. (STILL PLAY THE GAME THOUGH) =Barely anyone joins my server :( =Also, most fuckin' mods that are for DST are so cringe, like Undertale, anime, and furries, they get so much positivity for not atleast trying to make an original character (or just self inserting themselves).  Still, Great flippin' game overall, I LOVE it so much!!! Probably about a 9/10 for me.

Ton's of endless fun with friends, but the Workshop Errors get annoying I had a friend look through the error's and it is a Lua Script error and he cannot fix it however I do not think this is a problem with the game more a problem with the Developer of the Mod. But, a way too fix this issue is when you get the error and the Option either Leave the game or Disable Mods on top of it, it shows the list of mods enabled. Replace that with the mod(s) causing the error so the player/owner can delete it or contact the dev who made it too fix it. This is the only problem I find with the game but everything is great!

Keep in mind this game isn't finished. It's worth buying to support development, and even now it has plenty to make the purchase worthwhile. Controller support exists, but it's still in testing. You will have to hover your mouse over some menu options, like in settings or in the mod menu... but then you can use the Dpad to navigate. The settings menu requires you to hover your mouse over something that won't change value when you press A, in order to SAVE SETTINGS. Had to figure this out the hard way, no big deal... I'm sure they'll fix all these issues later... but even still, a controller feels great with this game, once you get used to the navigation issues. The in-game UI threw me off, but it makes a lot of sense once you feel it. I personally love it, the whole game. Atmosphere, music, controls, menu systems (that work), art style, and mod support!

I recommend this game as it is what it is, but don't be fooled by the cute graphics, it's harsh, your either freezing to death or overheating, if you survive that while getting resources some big ass giant will turn up each year to wipe what you build out, unless you proactively lure it away.  Finding out what you need to build and what you should keep makes it all so much worse, as not only is the above tedious trying to plan ahead with little knowledge of all the things ingame makes you want to throw your PC out the window!",1495979755,True

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

Story  - This game has no narrative, so...absent. Sound - Pretty good atmospheric sounds and ambience. Gameplay - There's a minimal sense of progression but all of it can be robbed of you pretty quickly. Without a leveling up system it leaves you feel like most games are a rush to get the best items and to hold out, like a surival game-lite moba. Replayability - Fair, but I'd still prefer Haven and Hearth over this. Positives:  +Attractive (if not a meme at this point) art style +Decent entry into the wave of survival-esque games +Cool sound effects +Doesn't require a gaming computer to run +Pick up and play +unlockable loot crate style items are more an ambiguous ""positive"" but it adds replayability Negatives: -Very weak combat system -Brutal winters unless you shorten them, thereby playing on a weaker difficulty setting -Griefers and player killers are abound on most non PVE servers -no strong sense of progression -no achievements  Final Verdict: I don't regret paying for it but I dont see myself playing DST very often with all the other survival type games out there that don't look like they were made in flash.",1500444017,True

76561198073600298,"Grass! Twigs! Berries! DEATH.  The name kinda tells you the base of the games objective but what you don't know is the depth of what you can and have to do to not starve. BUT NOW YOU CAN DO IT WITH FRIENDS!!  Find berries. death, carrots or kill animals for various types of meat that will fill your belly and even make you go insane! Depending on what food you eat, or how to prepare and cook it (by mixing it with other food and using a crock pot) it will restore more health, fill your hunger or increase/decrease your sanity bar. If you have the DLC (Reign of Giants) you will also have to deal with overheating and freezing to death (the freezing one is also in the base game)   Surviving is what your new life is about in this hellish new world. Find food, fight off monsters and hunger while always trying to keep yourself from going insane. Your food bar is always going down, forcing you to find food to fill your mighty belly. Health goes down when struck by enemies, eating rotten food or depending on your character (will talk about that below) damaged by certain specific events (like rain.) Watch your heat so you don't freeze to death, allowing your temp reach 0 or below will deal damage to you. But when its summer, watch out that the heat so welcomed in the winter will not give you heat stroke, causing the same effects and will cause unwanted damage to your player. Finally, your sanity. Sanity is drained passively while near thingys (objectives in survival mode) being in the darkness, at night in general, being near enemies or eating spoiled food or bad food. In the multiplayer version, you will also have to deal with people killing you and stealing your items. Make sure you focus on a good defense or offense to protect all you have worked for.  Many types of food to make, plenty of resources to scavenge for and potentially very massive maps that give you tons of content to explore for weapons, clothing, gadgets and trinkets.  Several unique characters make replaying when you die worthwhile, if you hate wilson and his scientific beard, play as the robot who hates rain, or as the strong man, who is a bulldozer on steroids when his hunger is filled but becomes weaker when it is not.  Track your progress and ""high scores"" by tallying your days (it will do this by itself and give you exp for new characters this way but more for bragging rights) and try and pass them every attempt.   You will die, trust me. The first couple tries will kill you and if by some luck or amazing skill you made it far enough to see your first winter, that will kill you.   Modded characters are fun to play, all set with their own pros and cons, and most being very balanced and playable in-game. + most of the mods are very helpful, like tracking your stats better, keeping your items better stacked and allowing for easier travel.

However, there are some points i did not like so much: First, the only way for us to get rid of lagging was a dedicated console server (this however works very well). Having to start a dedicated server is quite a piece of work, even though there is a docker image available.  Second, i really dislike games without a pause option. Its more or less impossible to leave your PC while running the game, this could have been handled better. Like using some kind of vote mechanism in multiplayer games.

76561198007547652,"Don't Starve Together is a nice, easy to play (but hard to master) fun survival permadeath game. I'd recommend it, except for one major problem.  With multiple people on the server, if you die you turn into a ghost. Somebody must use a Telltale Heart on you to revive you, or you will forever be a ghost and only be able to haunt people.  There's one major flaw with this; public servers. If you're in a public server just playing and don't have a friend to communicate with and give you a Telltale Heart, you are forever stuck as a ghost and can only haunt people until somebody decides to give you one. That is a TERRIBLE mechanic; it's a good idea except for the fact that you cannot respawn even if you want to. Maybe if you could respawn and just lose all your stuff versus being given a Telltale Heart and retaining it it would be okay, but the fact that if you, like me, were at 9 health running around in the night-time with a Blue Hound following you like a gay following his boyfriend endlessly until you are killed, and when it kills you you are eternally a ghost, makes it a terrible game.  Minus that fact, it's good.... but that is the most stupid thing ever. Don't Starve Together gives you the ability to host a dedicated server that is open for lots of players (who you don't necessarily know) but when you do that it punishes you by making it so if you die you must have another person to be able to revive you to be able to play the game, and if you don't, the world must be reset (for whatever reason) or you are forever Casper's twin.  P.S. this was a rage-induced review, so forgive me if I'm incorrect in any way.

Rubber-banding, getting hit by enemies from the opposite side of the screen, clicking something and failing to interact... you name the lag symptom, we've had it. We've tried everything to make it work: ""no lag"" mods, turning our computer settings to maximum power, not using cosmetic items, etc. Nothing works. Sometimes we can play for half an hour before the lag starts. Most of the time it starts within five minutes in the world. All of this even happens when we're on LAN.   Also, a small gripe: on the rare occasions we've gotten it to work, we discovered that thermal stones for winter now have durability in this version. Why? That's a horrible decision.

76561198250942048,"My rating is due to many often ignored cons about this game. For starters, the game is designed inherently to be played by casual gamers, however, the game is excessively punishing to casual players. You'll spend about 59 minutes out of every hour holding the A button and doing nothing else. The content of the game is tiny and isn't frequently updated enough to justify its current size and therefore, it has very small replay value. The game can be easily beaten in about 2 hours with most content unlocked. After you've beaten the game, the only way to continue playing it is to play it the same exact way you played it the other 3000 times you played it. The worst character in the game ""willow"" had a patch that nerfed her lighter, which wasn't even a good enough benefit to justify using her in the first place. Why nerf a character that's already virtually unplayable? Bad game design and decision making on a grand scale. There is a huge list I could pile onto the desk of other issues that face this game but most of that list would sound more like needless complaining rather than helpful information, so that's for you to speculate based on your own preferences and bias. However, the last thing I'll touch on is, the game is terrible with controller recognitions. If you use a PS controller, not only will the game treat it like Xbox, but in game, it will still instruct you to use a keyboard input rather than telling you which button on your controller to use. This can cause widespread confusion on new players and is often a complaint I see from them on different forums boards and other outlets. I'm done sacking on this game now. Enjoy.",1535250802,False

76561197966482898,"I bought this game for me and my long-distance girlfriend to play together.  And it was exactly what we needed.  Something that required intellectual skill, but not technical skill.  In other words, I was looking for a game that wouldn't be hard to play for a novice gamer like my GF.  Because this game uses a point and click interface, it was perfect.  Also like I said, this game requires teamwork and smart decisions to be successful.  You must communicate with your teammate and pay attention to many details.  There is very little room for rest in this game, and I find myself satisfied after only a single round.  Essentially the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.  To do this, some of the essential tasks will be finding or creating food, making clothing, resource gathering, staying warm, and fighting off monsters.  Items are crafted by gathering raw material and special items from the world such as grass, spider's silk, lumber, and minerals.  What's great about this game is its randomly generated terrain.  This essentially means you'll have to modify your strategy in every game.  Sometimes you'll be dropped in lush garden of eden.  Another time you may be dropped in a barren desert and have to travel a long ways to find a suitable campsite.  The ratios of fruits, raw material, and animals will also vary as well as their geographic location.  It's definitely a game of learning from mistakes and trail and error.  You'll learn to set goals to achieve in x number of days, avoid danger, memorize crafting recipes, prepare for sudden weather and monster attacks, and sustain yourself.  Be prepared to meet moments of indecision as there are many many items that can be crafted.  I recommend consulting the wiki as you learn more.  I'd recommend this to any one who likes co op games.

At first this game handled lootboxes considerably better than most other implementations of RNG based microtransactions as all rewards were earned ingame, with [u]absolutely no in game store[/u] deviously manipulating you to buy packs, and it really did feel rewarding to open boxes unlike pretty much every other game using them. But now that those days are over any enjoyment i might get out of opening a lootbox is overshadowed by the pessimistic dread that accompanies these predatory monetization systems. I'd be fine with spending a little to help support the game if i didn't have to gamble for what i want, and even if lootboxes are not legally gambling, it is just as predatory and unethical.

76561198050816685,"Don't starve together is certainly unforgiving. With no tutorial whatsoever, nor tooltips, the game seems to be built around exploration and tactics to survive. There are four seasons: Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer. Autumn is the default with no environmental hazards. You heard me.  Each season sans autumn has an environmental hazard. Winter has its cold, threatening to kill you of frostbite. Spring has rain, driving the non-british characters of don't starve together (bloody yanks) to nuts and bolts. You might think summer would be the safest season. It is far from THAT! You'd need a lot of nitre and at least two thermal stones just to survive, as well as clever manipulation of underground and above ground resources. You should never waste resources in this game. Every single one counts.  Let me tell you something about spring - which killed me more than once. Spring rains are very common, requiring you to make an umbrella by killing a pig or finding a source of pig skin through pig heads/pig houses. Now, when you do make an umbrella, expect to be struck by lightning frequently lest you make a lightning rod. Yet even a lightning rod cannot protect you from the horrors of the French, Hon hon hon, they laugh as they fall out of the sky, killing you by surrounding you, then punching your private parts with the sheer force of their disgusting tongue. Wretched and evil is the tongue of the French, that it smells of stinky cheese and escargot. They need not even aim it directly at you - the sheer smell is enough to damage you. Their pilots are dangerous, dropping them off when visibility is low and our fighters cannot engage their transports. The battle is hard fought with your own infantrymen punching, getting at the French, but they outnumber them, and eventually succumb to their disgust and die. You must retreat, in utter humiliation, and eventually stare down the face of death itself - frogs.",1468000366,True

76561197972040704,"My opinion will assuredly be a divisive one, but I find that the best survival games are games in which dealing with hunger, thirst, etc. are something that is a huge deal, but eventually wanes after you establish a good base of operations and a system, making the gathering of food, water, etc. a very minor task with other activities taking the forefront.   Empyrion Galactic Survival had me picking plants and killing space raptors and cooking the meat to stay alive while on the run, trying to heal myself and get some ore and supplies to build, and once I stayed alive long enough to build a little base, I could make a refrigerator and a little farm with growth lights over it and make my own food. After that, I had to always be wary of my hunger, but it was not the entire goal of the game any more. In Subnautica, getting fish to eat was and fish to produce water from was a big deal. Then you get a few upgrades, find the most filling fish, pack 'em with salt to make them last, find spots with heaps of water-generating fish and machine parts to extract clean water, and you're good to go! You always have to watch the meter and carry some goodies with you, but that is largely behind you now. Even Minecraft, which I didn't really like, allows you to heavily get some production going to handle hunger.  In Don't Starve Together, however, even with a team mate, food acquisition was our entire point of existence for far too long. She would wander off desperately looking for food, I would do the same, and we'd meet back up and eat what we had. It was never enough, despite devoting our entire in-game days to gathering food and just enough wood, etc. to make a fire to survive through the night. On a few other runs, we tried creating technology, but we could not find the components we needed to create stuff that would be of any use. On top of that, I simply did not like the tech options that were listed based on what I read of them.  To me, this game was a complete and utter chore to play. I am not exaggerating when I say that I would rather be at work than playing this game. I am happy that others are able to derive some joy from it, though I absolutely cannot.

The game keeps throwing challenges at you, or destroying your stuff to make it seem more than it is. I found the fact that this game has many rave reviews bothersome. I cannot find much to like about the game other than art and sound.      The game itself wouldn't be that bad, if it had some kind of story, or reason for you to do these things. What it gives you is a randomly generated world that has limited reasources, which forces you to move on continuously. Leaving behind all the items you have built. For some people this may be fun. As for me I found it as enjoyable as working in an assembly plant. With all the charm too.       I have interacted with the ""community"" for about a month or so and have found them lacking. I have had to edit my review multiple times to hopefully help to them understand why I don't like this game.       I even tried again to like this game after the ""community"" bashed on me for writing a negative review. I found myself gazing at the game in a mild hypnosis, grinding away getting resources. I was in a trance for about 2hrs, not because I liked the game, or because I was enjoying myself, but because I was just playing to play.       After that I took the time to re-edit my review and again the ""community"" pounced and started hating on me for not like their game. Well too bad, I can't find any more redeeming qualities to the game or its ""community."" I don't feel like being part of a ""communtiy"" that has to defend its like of a game by tearing those who don't like it down.

The Forge gamemode: It is a gamemode I've enjoyed a lot which is the closest thing this game has to a dungeon. Despite the fact that there is no innate competitiveness, there is a lot of rampant toxicity and elitism in The Forge gamemode. Every game I've played in that mode, there was someone harassing another player based on either their ""level"" or ""wrong actions"" in-game. Since there is no mute button or report feature, a lot of these issues fly under the radar and I expect this level of toxicity to remain constant despite the casualness of the game.   Base game: Even though it is a co-op game, a lot of the players harbour a constant fear of strangers leading them to be very hesitant in offering aid. Couple that with the fact that certain players expect others to be a veteran DS player creates a community that is not very helpful or welcoming towards newer players. Admittedly, griefers may appear and burn down your base or newer players may not know what to do and drain your resources. This paranoia permeates throughout the playerbase. Nevertheless, it is a game that requires a lot of personal research on your part despite its casual nature. There is no definite goal to the game, you are simply required to survive for as long as you can. Progression in the game as a whole is based on getting cosmetic items.",1543042571,False

Don't starve together can be played single player or co-op, The majority of my little hours are co-op and a small amount of time singleplayer.  The game has a cool old fashioned art style and danger around every corner, unlike the first Don't Starve, death is not permanent; but does have a negative effect on future play.   Finding resources is easy, but you need to obtain large quantities for your crafting, which is fairly likited but enough for it to still be enjoyable.  Combat is an option, but isn't viable most of the time. You can craft spears and some swords late game, and basic armour that can help soak up a few more hits; but thats about it. Combat will get you killed.  All the tools die very quickly, even the harder to make ones with gold and other difficult to obtain resources.   Cooking is awesome, but requires lots of different ingredients which are usually painful to obtain. Also, very little dishes replenish health, and if they do it's never very much.  Imo, if I was motivated to play I'd have a blast.

My friends had bugs like clicking a monster to attack it, instead they start walking towards it. Stuff like that put us off a lot. A couple of months later this game is a blast. We had so much fun without all these bugs. It was amazing to just play all afternoon, build a nice big base, have stored enough food and materials to survive the winter, just so a giant can come, destroy out base and kill us. Twice. On two worlds. Even then it was fun and enjoyable. I recommend this game to and survival game fan as this is one pretty hardcore survival and rogue-like game. If you have 2-3 friends to play with, I suggest playing with them instead of joining a random server, but it's up to you.

Also want to go over the lag, you can work for a couple hours gathering stuff to get read for pvp then once you enter any kind of combat start rubber banding, which means your character will appear to be moving then dissapear or walk back to the spot you started lagging out on. its a host problem for the deicated servers so if they could update those it would be alot more playable. imagine getting attacked and trying to run away, with everytime you get some distance between you and your enemy and you think you got away, your character appears right back next to the enemy and half your health is gone, repeat until your frusturated and dead. in conclusion the game needs way more content as its way to easy to reach a point where you built everything and your kinda just waiting to die and start over. the dedicated servers need to be completely redone and the lag on those servers needd to be worked on for lag issues.",1422209364,False

Each base game character has pros and cons that allow them to be balanced yet fun, the combinations of these characters abilities also adds variety to gameplay.  Pros: Fun to play with friends Random worlds add challenge The customisation of characters (Visual and Team Composition is fun) The settings allow even more customisation of the world Mods from the community section add a lot of replay value  Cons: With many players the food can be lacking in some biomes The game can seem too punishing with enemies (Walrus Range etc.) ",1562178490,True

The game demands that you adapt and not only with the survival of the days, there are a lot of monsters that you can fight, even there are boss fights (boss fights that i not reached cuz, with my friends, we're a disaster).

Next we have the friend that has a mild sexual relationship to our crock pots and often does not trek further out than 10 m before getting homesick, not gunna lie hes pretty useless, but he makes us a tonne of food a bit like a housewife. Then we have friend number 3, who has recently been diagnosed with mild accute uselessness syndrome  symptoms: standing aroun the camp the entire day moaning about having nothing to do being useless dying abmormerly  he has set the record of dying the fasted as possible and he is bassically the definition of a noob.

76561198067601558,"Been some time since I started playing this one, huh? Nevertheless The Don't Starve Together is STILL one of those survival games, that are Actually cool. Graphics are unique Klei style. It's like a comic book/video game crossover. Every monster, character and even object has unique feel to it, as well.  Gameplay isn't just ""another survival game"" thing. It may seem simple at first, maybe even repetitive. But I still enjoyed farming stuff and repeatedly punching spiders in the face with a homemade Ham Bat (yes, iconic DS's weapon of choice), just for fun. Also, one of the hardest things in this game is planning ""What do I do next?"" stuff and being time efficient. And, of course, dealing with your friends absorbing fridge's contents, faster than you fill it. I guess you can't even free yourself from your silly buddies when going into virtual world. But it's not like I didn't enjoy having an extra challange, heh.  Audio fits well, it gives different tone to each of the Seasons present in game, e.g. Winter feels rather sad, Spring is a bit jumpy (in it's own positive purport). Of course, there couldn't be a good ol' Boss Fight, without the good ol' Boss Theme. Indeed, this game provides you with some encouraging tunes for such occasions.  Story. Yes, this game has a rather impressive lore for a survival game. Most of it is present outside of the game, though. Still worth doing a lil' research. DST's plotline is separate from Don't Starve (Alone)'s.  ------TL;DR------ Pretty decent survival game with unique artstyle, music, nice lore and Meatballs. Takes some time to get good at it (and lots of deaths). And Together implies you'll be able to get some friends to play with OR you'll have to use all of your patience for public plays.

DAY 1:  my friend went out for some silk and my other friend got wood and i was left to mine and gather food. Long story short my friend getting silk got killed by spider queen (dont ask ok) and my other friend was being attacked by treeguard. My friend managed to kill some spiders with his axe so i got 2 glands but my friend was low on health from treeguard  and i didnt know who to save. I ended up saving the guy dead, and we helped my other friend with treeguard. Day 2: Ok so we werent that good at the game and we decided to go into a cave but i was left behind in case of emergency. My friends didnt have the tools to survive in the cave and died from a variety of different things (earthquake, bunnymen, tentacles, etc) and i was last one alive. wow. Day 7: OK i was doing good on my own until i realized my sanity was low from the ghosts. I died from my own insanity and gg no re.       A year after buying:   Day 26: Me and the same group of friends were doing really well and decided to plan how we were gonna defeatdeerclops. We had plenty of food and supplies and we were fine on warmth.  Day 30: We beat deerclops but one of our friends died. The other died from cold/spiders trying to save said friend.

76561198098442932,"A very enjoyable game for people new to Don't Starve Together or returning players from Don't Starve. Sacrificing some content/modding abilities from the single player version to have fun, multiplayer style. The more players working to not starve, go insane or die together, the better i'd say.  In my personal experience Autumn is a good starting point and is quite an enjoyable season because in this season the players must get busy in preperation for winter and giants to come.   Winter hits, at first there is a bit of struggle, we hunt, travel, then gameplay becomes quite boring until the Deerclops spawns. (mostly because my friends and I feel their isn't much else to do at that moment but to wait out Winter. But that may be just our ignorence.)  Spring, is a pretty annoying season. Food does not dry while raining, periods of rain are really long, and your insanity drops very fast. But thanks to heat and items such as umbrellas i feel spring is pretty balenced.  (Fighting the Moose boss was no walk in the park.....especially since we got Rekt'd by the little gooslings........)  Summer, ah summer, the season of rage quit and throwing your computer out the window.

76561198171033130,"The pinnacle of survival games, which actually requires players to survive. Normally survival games are just, start off with nothing in the wilderness, kill everything else and build a castle. This game requires players to actually work to stay alive and build a settlement to further aid in their survival creating a highly unique and innovative experience. Unlike many other games, it also uses a very stylized and intricate art style as well as having a very well written although unspoken plot.  The game features a healthy amount of randomization which makes each world relatively individual and fresh, and while the combat system is simple it manages to still feel satisfying. While including a lot of grinding like most survival games, in this one it barely feels like a chore because the player is constantly working to gather the supplies to immediately build something new. There are only a few instances where the reward for time spent is very far off, what the player chooses to do is rewarded or punished very quickly.  The game however makes no effort to teach the player anything, which results in both a more refreshing experience and an unfair one. Players will die numerous times to things they had no way of preparing for without looking up a guide, which potentially involves numerous world resets and lost progress. It does not feel as bad as normal trial-and-error psuedo difficult gameplay, but it still can be a problem. Especially when the game will continue to dish out unfair situations even after players are experienced; as there is always one more thing players did not know, which they are punished for not knowing.  Finally, the game also has problems with balance. As there are many overly effective tactics players can use to make survival much easier. The game puts so much effort into being punishing and unforgiving yet there are random aspects of the system which are far more lenient to the player for no reason. Which means if players enjoy difficulty the game hypocritically makes certain things far easier then they should be, just because. Various content in the game is also underpowered or overpowered in general, and so there are certain items players will default to using a lot and others they barely will. This even including the playable characters.  While the multiplayer side of the game is exceptionally enjoyable, when in a good team, the public multiplayer is still susceptible to griefing. Although after a couple years some counters to griefing were finally patched in. There are also various bosses in the game which have their health scaled to ridiculous amounts in anticipation for multiple players being present, and so playing the game alone or with a small group will make certain fights unfairly challenging without the use of a health scaling mod.

76561198032527136,"Not so much a review, more of a few suggestions I wanted to make...  1) When you first boot up the game you are met with a screen with, besides other things, a ""play"" button and a ""quit"" button. Obviously in this window, clicking the quit button quits the game.  And the play button takes you to the main menu.  Now, at this point after pressing the play button, you're met with a ""logging in"" screen with an optional ""offline mode"" button on it.  Couldn't that be an option within the main menu itself rather than being automatic? Because my next issue is to do with the main menu itself.  My biggest issue is that the main menu ALSO has a ""quit"" button that quits the game. Basically, I think either you remove the redundant opening screen or you make the quit button go back to it.  Like I said a few lines ago, the ""logging in"" thing should be optional, because if I'm to slow to click ""offline"" then I'd have to quit and reopen the game again which, in my opinion, is a little convoluted.  Also, I don't know if it's just my computer, but the resolution seems to be terrible for me (1366 x 768) Is it because the game is dealing with an unknown shape and it's being squished unnaturally?",1554121314,True

Days getting shorter, nights getting longer just waiting for the souls to get you. Earn character customizations while you're sitting near your science station crafting items to help you.

Ok so now really, this game is all about, well... Surviving of course with friends. You get spawned, then immedietally have to search for supplies because night is coming, and it's coming fast. Then you forget to look at the clock, and it's night... First restart. Then you find these pigs, and are excited because they help you survive. Until... The green pigs come, and destroy you. Then you get way further just for you to realise... WAIT IT'S WINTER?!?! Another restart. You're prepared for winter this time, then you survive for quite a bit longer. Then... The unexpected happens. You're house lights on fire because it's... Guess what? Summer! Then you have to restart building, or restart because you're in the flames of your burning house. I think this is a warning for all new players.. Simply watch out for the cycle. When it's winter try to be prepared with a coat before hand, when it's summer put fans near the wood at your house, and you. Then all frustration ends, and you're back to normal, and happy again...

76561198335473938,"First off, it'll say this review was posted in 2017. Well I've changed my mind at this point and time. Just... read if you want to find out the horrible truth.. This game. Oh boy. Don't Starve Together is an amazing game, with developers that care so much about the game that they don't patch bugs that have been in for 4 years and literally break the ga- heh, anyways, it's still a very enjoyable experience overall, but I had just experienced the most disturbing thing I'll possibly ever see. I absolutely cannot recommend this game just due to the chance that this might happen to anyone else.  Ok, so, there is a character in the game named Wigfrid who is a battle warrior and mostly has to hunt for food. So I was just hunting right, in the middle of a desert, just waiting for that delicious koalefant to soon be in my stomach. But, well, there is also a 5% chance something much more terrifying can spawn. And I was one unlucky warrior that night. The ""Varg"" (swedish for Wolf) is a massive Wolf that summons its other wolves to aid it in combat. It's truly an overwhelming enemy. Well, before I knew it, I was completely surrounded by hounds. But something was wrong.  The Varg deeply stared at me, and the hounds just kept barking. Usually after about 3 barks they attack. Well, all I had at the moment was like, some grass and twigs in my pocket and the Wigfrid character's battle spear and battle helmet. The hounds suddenly just darted in and carried everything I had away in their mouthes... keep in mind this whole time I was alone and in the middle of a desert. Well, within just a few more seconds, they tore off my skin ""Shadow Armor"". It's just a skin so not actual armor. Anyways, not much longer I was tackled by the mighty Varg itself. I knew I should have died at that moment. But life just kept going at me, huh?  You can probably imagine what happened right after that. So much was going on, I, I didn't know what to do. It was only about 30 seconds in that I had the entire scence scarred into my mind. Some time later my character just completely got knocked out, which I'm assuming was from deleriousness from the extreme pleasure. My character woke up the next morning with all the stuff I had next to me. Well, my hunger was full at least. I came back to the base very ashamed that day. Pretty much everyone laughed at me, some took screenshots. It was horrid, but nowhere near as horrid of what had happened yesterday. Sigh. Even Wigfrid was groggy, started looking like she was crying later.   Well, all in all, this game is what happens when developers make something good and decide to completely ruin it from just one thing. And yes, I know, you do not have to hunt in the game. But at one point in time, you'll go hungry and no one has food. It'll be your only chance really. And just the chance, that 5% chance of getting that image burned into your head. That's something scary.  If you do decide to get this game anyway, please. Just contradict the title. It's much better to embarrasingly starve than... I don't even want to remind myself of it anymore. Well, bye. Please, save yourselves from the Varg.",1491795212,False

I have played this series a long time, and Don't Starve Together was the iteration it always needed.  Don't Starve was BEGGING for multiplayer.  This game should be extremely fun with friends, to the point that I begged and wheedled everyone I knew to get it.  It's going to be amazing, I said.  I put a lot of my credit on the line with them; at my age, you don't have many friends, and about 10% of those still play video games.  I honestly wish I hadn't, because currently, Don't Starve Together is basically unplayable.  The rubberbanding gets worse and worse, the lag is atrocious.  Even on home network, playing with my girlfriend, it gets to be that you have to continuously restart the game until you don't feel like playing anymore.  We finally got everyone together online, my friend who more or less owns a supercomputer and 250mb down/50mb up connection hosted the game.  Within an hour, we were restarting the game every few minutes.     I am so goddamn embarrassed that I recommended this game to everyone, and we all got together for a night of playing, and couldn't enjoy ourselves, even with only 4 players.  If you read the reviews, this rubberbanding and lag issue has been going on since the release of the game, and the developers don't seem to be doing anything to resolve it.

Well since they offer a free copy of the game with the oringinal purchase of the game for 14.99 I gifted it to my friend and we've been playing it together ever since,this game is tremendous amounts of fun with a friend,probably even more fun if you have multiple friends to play it with!   So here's a lil story of our adventures together.  As I SabinSaberWolf and his trusty friend by his side we stared at this world bravely with no fear,but yet to know what the world actually had in stored for us. Our first adventure together we began trotting along the road and decide to make basecamp near a pond,we seen no frogs as it seemed to be deserted we ignored the fact there were two other ponds near by as we gathered supplies on day 3 we returned back to camp to live through the night by our warm fire as the morning soon came,least did we know we were attacked by a frog army,we ran and ran,but they wouldn't quit chasing us as we refused to give up our home! We decided to fight back,but soon did I notice my friend had fallen by the frog meanace! I refused to leave her there as I decided to fight the frogs to the death! I managed to kill one frog,but sadly the frog nation proved to be way more powerful than we could have ever imagined.  Our second adventure. Crazed out of our minds about what has just happened with the frogs we decided to play it more carefully and on our toes! Prepared for the frog nation as to whether it would attack again! We made a camp on the edge of the world where it was safe from the devilish frogs! As we remained safe and sound near rabbits.as a few days past we ate through all our supply of food and was forced to explore the world more in to the depths of the unknow,as we saw a few harmless bees we thought nothing of it,until we soon saw about 100 more nests as most of em' turned out to be evil bee nests,we quickly ran through the unknown to try and get away from the evil bees as they kept coming and coming as there were nests everywhere! There was no escape! They murdered my friend in cold blood as I knew I was outmatched with only my axe,as we only came there for some food as peaceful travelers! Least did I know I ran in to a dead end with no escape in sight as I stood there cornered by the evil bees with my axe in hand ready to fight to the death and for the honour of my friend! I swung and swung my axe with no mercy as I managed to murder two of the evil bees,but the rest still managed to over power me as I fell to the ground feeling my body getting cold from the multiple bee stings as the whole world soon turns to black as I awaken as a ghost and see my friend there staring at me as now we spend together forever as peaceful ghosts,but yet did we know,we were enterring in to a whole new world!  Adventure Three There isn't much danger in this adventure we managed to build up a camp with a hay wall built all around us with traps for bunnies n a farm growing our food together learning new things through our marvelous science machine,as we have not met anything to fear yet,we are living a pretty good life together surviving day by day,keeping each other sane as we possibly could. We're living the dream for now,everything is going so well for us now,is this really our happy ever after? Or is there something out there in the darkness stalking us? We try not to worry,but we have no idea what is haunting us,but we insure to be prepared for what ever life throws at us now! We musn't fail as this must be our time!  That's all of our adventures summed up to a point.  So in my opinion I give this game a perfect 10/10 one of the best games I have ever played in a long while that is co-op with a survival aspect. Also hopefully my lil stories didn't leave you a bore.",1439440801,True

76561198037516530,"Started playing this game with my roomate and both of us were disappointed.  Neither of us played the single player version.  There really wasn't anything ""fun"" about this game.  During the day, you feverishly scramble across the landscape grabbing all kinds of stuff that might be useful.  Night is fairly short, and you pretty much sit there by the fire, feverishly cooking food and getting as much crafting done as possible.  Then it's back to feverishly trying to find stuff around the world.  There really is no ""calm,"" at least for a relatively new player.  You're always slowly dying from starvation, too fast in my opinion.  A feverish pace is required for survival which, as a n00b, makes it difficult to explore the different, potentially cool stuff you could craft or explore.  Combat is terrible, and it's difficult to click on your enemy.  The game discourages fighting and experimentation by making death very punishing.  You have to find a special stone somewhere in the world or craft a relatively advanced meat effigy to resurrect one of you.  Nothing about the game is very rewarding.  Collecting stuff is rather mundane.  The traps are whatever.  Crafting something like an umbrella when it rains is just a way to die slower.  You don't build a cool house or anything like that - you're stuck with basic and advanced versions of an outdoor camp site.  BUT YOU MUST SURVIVE!!!!! ?? But why? What's the goal?  Survival? Okay, but that by itself isn't very fun.  Can I make a badass mansion or a cart track like in Minecraft?  No...  Do I get a well-designed, dynamic, and intense scavenging/trading experience like in This War of Mine? No........  Okay, do I get varied and interesting weapons, armor, and equipment like in Terraria?  No.....  Do I get a deep sense of human fear and connectedness, like in Day Z, when I'm not sure if someone will help me survive or literally kill me?  No.  Play another survival game.",1452579081,False

76561198183518214,"I was originally bagered by a friend to download this game so we could play together.  All I can say is, i'm glad I didn't spend my own money on this game.  To sum it up, you run around as different selectable cartoon characters- each with their own strength in ""something"" and each with their own particular weakness.  EX: Willow gains sanity points from fire, however if she becomes insane begins to freeze to death.  EX 2: Wendy has a ghost sidekick (her sister) who can fight for/with her. She can aggro and tank enemies, and deal damage. However Wendy herself has some of the lowest base attack damage in the game and has a hard time killing without her ghost.  The goal is simple: To survive. You must run around and gather food, collect materials, and build items to help you survive through each season or die. (EX: you need to gather items and craft warm clothing for the winter season or risk freezing to death). You also have to fight with the strange creatures that inhabit the land, some friendly but many of which will try to kill you for no reason. There are also boss fights at set intervals in the game, usually one for each season.  HOWEVER.  Why am I not giving this game a positive review?  Honestly this game loses its novelty very quickly. Once you survive through all the seasons at least once, you have gathered basically everything you need to survive those four seasons again. (The seasons loop).   The only real task you will have is basically gathering from then on, as you've probably explored 99% of the map by the end of the  four seasons. You'll run around just restocking on food, if you haven't already created your base camp next to the beefalo (some of the best source of meat in the game) and relocated all the tree's, saplings, and berry bushes you need right around your camp. Although you will have to leave to gather ores, as rocks are the only thing unrelocatable for convinence.  The only real replay value in this game is if you decide you want to try to survive with a different character, which will require some slight tweaking on how you approach surviving but not by extremely too much unless your the mime guy who basically dies to everything.   So sure, feel free to survive until day 100.....day 200.....day 300. It's just gonna be a repeat of all the crap you spent doing the first runthrough of the 4 seasons. Nothing new really occurs.  The Caves BETA is a very nice addition to the game, Kudo's to the developers on it. It does add another intresting layer of depth to the game. Instead of trying to survive on the base map you can try to survive underground in the caves, which poses a whole new set of challenges, and different creatures/plants/objects inhabit the caves below. That being said once you conquer the caves your back to the original rinse and reuse and repeat problem as stated above.  FINAL VERDICT:  First 3-4 playthroughs: 7.5/10  Replayability: 3/10  S/N: Im serious guys, It got to a point where me and my friend  legit had nothing else to do and conquer in the game that I started arranging berry bushes and tree's for fun for about 2 hours.

76561197967130716,"[h1]Don't Starve Together: 2 hours in review[/h1]  [b]Summary[/b]: A quirky open-world survival game that will trick you into a false sense of security with its Burton-esque art and goofy mannerisms and then punish you greatly by the end of night one.  In a sea of hyper-realistic survival sims, DST is a welcome breath of fresh air. Set in a strange little world that looks as if it was ripped from Tim Burton's mind, the game has little in the way of background. In the Single Player (Don't Starve) you wake to a man telling you that you had better find food before nightfall. No context, no other back story, just get out there and survive. In DST, you and your friends emerge out of a portal and set out to explore and survive. Lots of little laughs can be had at your character's comments and observations as well as the silly little things going on in the world.  DST doesn't seem brutal at first. There are cute little sprites for characters in the pseudo 3D world that bound about. Frogs, bees, rabbits, and a number of other creatures move around the world with you. Flowers grow and bloom, trees stand tall, and berry's hang from bushes inviting you to eat them. There are  few goofy moments as you run about collecting things, crafting thing, but this is a bit of a facade and perhaps your first enemy in the game. This game is surprisingly tough. It reminds me of Minecraft and DayZmod before there were guides up on the net. You get out, you run around, and maybe you attack something in hopes of food...then you die. You get out, you run around, and then it gets dark.....then you die. You get out, you run around, you survive the night and then you starve to death, or you run into some of the mechanical pig things that charge you, or you catch fire. As cute as it seems, it can be unforgiving. And when you die, you've got to have a buddy craft a heart to bring you back or you're stuck haunting around as a ghost.  Don't worry, though, its that challenging that's fun enough to keep you wanting more of it.  [b]The Good[/b]: The Atmosphere of the game is great. I love the Gothic, Burton-looking art style, and everything fits together very well. The game-play seems pretty balanced, and the crafting is handled quite easily; you don't have to put together complex patterns or obscure combos, everything is listed and what-not, which is good because you'll be a little more focused on surviving.  [b]The Bad[/b]: Its not for the easily frustrated. You'll probably have a good number of deaths in the first go of it. Some times the worlds spawn things you need early on in very rare quantities, and that can lead to you running around with nothing progressing for a while. You can fix this by customizing the set up for the server if you want.  [b]The Ugly[/b]: Finding spiders so you can craft the resurrection item sucks.

Don't starve with food would means that the people are just refusing to eat causing starvation which will lead to the stomach eating itself. Don't starve without food means that the people  either can not find food or have to fight for it and end up losing  the food which will also lead to the stomach eating itself.

76561198050345005,"The explanation of the Frontier Pack is pretty misleading, not very clear, and thus kind of useless. I already owned Don't Starve so I was just going to wait until it was free (if I understand what they are saying, although noone really seems to know). Then I saw the Frontier Pack that said you would buy Don't Starve and 2 copies of Don't Starve Together. For whatever reason, they decided that you can't take that particular copy of Don't Starve as a gift, so I just wasted money by buying the game I already have a second time, and STILL had to buy a THIRD copy to give to my friend. I think that's a bit excessive and pretty cheap. Maybe I just don't understand exactly how this works though? I didn't think it was unreasonable to think that I could use the 2nd copy of a game I already owned as a gift for a friend...  I know these reviews are supposed to be for gameplay, but right off the bat, that's a pretty frustrating issue. I shouldn't be confused about what I'm buying when I buy something. I read through the description more than once and also read the note they had for downloading it. Because of their poor advertisement and enclear writing, I've marked that I do NOT reccommend. HOWEVER, having played Don't Starve, I'm sure the gameplay is fine. If you do not own Don't Starve at all, this will probably be a very fun experience. My negative thoughts are solely based on how they handled people who already own the game. For everyone else, I do recommend this game.

The actual reason is that they don't port Shipwrecked to DST, lore-wise, Shipwrecked is a mere dream, so implementing it would be lore-friendly. Also, we need the option to play DST without hosting a server, in DS, having caves enabled didn't lag the player at all, but in DST, having caves enabled makes a significant lag.

76561198135614621,"""Overwhelmingly Positive"" There are several good reasons for why everyone rates this game well. While with the newer updates, it's getting harder for me to play (shitty computer), this game is still wonderful. Granted, in the beginning, a tutorial would've been lovely, and coming from me this means something considering how much I love exploring a game without the tutorial. If you're going to play, I recommend watching some Let's Plays or Tutorials. Now, onto the actual review;  This game is amazing, a lovely mix between 2D models in a 3D world, several bosses to keep you on your toes, and so, so many ways to die. Combined with several mods you can play, this game is hard to fall out of love with. Whether it being new bosses, new characters, or Klei's well made events, it's great fun to play. Want to become an almighty Spider Overlord? Well, become Webber! Want to demolish an entire ecosystem of trees and eventually get demolished by Treeguards, well... that can be any character... but hey, choose Woodie or Maxwell! Several characters for several play-styles, along with many bosses like the Spider Queen, Treeguards, Deerclops, Moose (accompanied with the deadly, yet cutely weird Moslings), even... a tiny Mushroom Tree... Huh... I feel like chopping it...  Anyway, away from the bosses, there are so many ways you can control this game. Believe it or not, starving is the least of your problems. Want to take up herding? We got Koalephants and Beefalo for you. Massive farming? Probably want to choose Wickerbottom for this, but from Berries to Dragonfruit, choose whatever you feel like growing. Just remember the several recipes if you don't want to get Smart Pot (mod). There are several things from Spider farming, Pig farming, Bee farming, plant harvesting, as well as fishing just to keep saturated. Each boss has their unique trait, along with many different ways to kite them. Pretty hard to kill a few of them with just some melee weapons. If you feel like it, you can even do Butterfly harvesting, cause Klei made a use for Butterflies! Just make sure you don't get too greedy. Unless you like weird demon Santa Clauses. With several mechanics, beautifully made worlds, and just the sheer difficulty of surviving a few hundred days, filled with hours of fun, this game is a heavy recommend from me.",1572430872,True

My friend was unable to find my world, and it took forever for me to find her game after she gave up. It was an infinite loading screen for her. Once we actually tried to get in the game DST just completely stopped responding and my computer froze for a few minutes before it crashed. Neither of our computers have run DST like this before, neither does it struggle so much with any other games. What happened? It used to be laggy, but it was still playable. Lately though it is impossible. Can't recommend a game that doesn't work.

Playing with friends, on the other hand, makes things a lot more interesting.  Being the douchebag that I am, it is always fun to verbally abuse and mess with people.  At the moment, I play this game with a friend and some random kid that we have made into our slave, aka b*tch.  He does most of the work, such as gathering and crafting.  He also plays a robot, which are designed to be the slave to man.  Therefore, it is the perfect role for him.  As a man, I do the hunting.  I bring home the bacon, in this case, rabbits.  We also have a woman.  She is pretty useless.  All she does is pms and burn down all the berry bushes the robot worked so hard to tend and grow.  She tells me she didn't do it on purpose, but who can believe the words of a woman?  I know I can't.  I always make sure I am well fed and well rested.  The safety and wellness of the others matter very little to me.  With a full belly and rested body,  I do not have to fear anything.    I usually start my day with breakfast.  Its usually meatballs.  Who doesn't like meat and balls?  After a hearty unbalanced breakfast, I make my rounds, putting rabbits in chests.  They survive indefinitely with no food or water, until I murder them.  I collect seeds, poop, and materials along the way, but I never venture far.  I have my robot slave for the hard labor.  The woman also like venturing off.  At the end of the day, I come back and eat more meat.  Sometimes, I am nice enough to cook more for the servants.  Sometimes, I don't.  I enjoy it when they rush back as fast as they can, hoping there will be food there, while they are on the verge of death from starvation.  It makes things more interesting.

If you join 5 minutes late, good luck chopping a tree down in the first week.  Make a bird cage, someone picks the bird out of it, and eats it before dying, then they drain your sanity as a ghost.  Almost dead?  Make some food, wait for it to finish then die in front of the crock pot as someone else takes it.  Need rocks?  Too bad, someone already made a giant wall around the base.  Added bonus: You can't chase away the hands when you get low on sanity.  Current playstyle: Hoard grass, hoard flint, hoard gold, hoard everything, then die, leave, or just sit on it while others have nothing.  Make a beefalo pen?  someone will kill it, eat the meat.  Oh, and don't forget the frog rain.  Say you have 5 people in the game.  One noob decides to attack a frog, and they swarm, kill them, then another player, then another.

Traditionally survival games have you build up to a point, but after two evenings of playing with 5 people we have no shelter, no armor, no weapons, nothing. We barely are able to build a science machine before some hostile creature comes and ruins everything. Trying to collect resources is like pulling teeth. You step 100 feet away from your spawn and you get chased down by a pack of 6 hounds, each with 150 health, while you get a measly amount of health and are lucky to do 20 damage on a hit, meanwhile the hounds can kill you in 1-3 hits. And each time you die your max health gets lowered until you can get one hit by a bumblebee. Progression is basically impossible as enemies are vastly more powerful than the player, and theres no progression of difficulty.

76561198032387023,"Tedious game with a beautiful make-up. Don’t Starve is one of the more popular indie games of the recent years for reasons I simply do not understand. It does look charming indeed. In fact, it has beautiful Tim Burtonesque style graphics and the game easily grabs the attention of anyone who takes a look at the screenshots. You start as a character whose only goal is to survive as long as possible. Similar to other survival games, you farm, craft, build to stay alive. The first problem with Don’t Starve is that the grinding part is simply boring. Often, it feels like a flash game with a fairly bad user interface where you click, click, click with your left mouse button without having any kind of fun. If you are curious about how grinding can be fun, please check Terraria out.   Second major problem with Don’t Starve is the permadeath. I am not suggesting that permadeath is bad per se, it can be quite enjoyable when it is done right. In Don’t Starve, however, it turns the tedious game design into something unbearable. You may find yourself grinding for hours, just to die by a random encounter (and it won’t be your fault). Oh yeah, some might suggest “that’s what the game is about” or “you will learn from your death”. Just give me a break… By now you should have played plenty of difficult video games to differentiate good game design from bad ones. Just look at the Souls series. When you die, you know you made a mistake. Maybe you made your move too early. Maybe you did not block the attack when you were supposed to. And if you die, you may lose your “souls” and thereby some of your progress, but not the entire game. In Don’t Starve, unless you are playing with a second monitor with wiki open, there is no way of knowing what will kill you. The only way to learn about what kills you is to be killed by it. And then you will start over, go through the tedious grind for hours and die again for another reason you could simply not prevent. In Don’t Starve, you are Sisyphus…   Last but not the least, the combat is atrocious. Combat in Don’t Starve is literally the same combat in any of the other thousands of flash games. If you have a good armor, left click the enemy until it dies. Or alternatively, make the enemy chase you and do your attacks while you are on the run.   If dull, repetitive games with poorly executed game mechanics are for you, play Don’t Starve. If you have a friend who happens to have the same tastes as you do, play Don’t Starve Together. But if it is the art style that pulls you in, your valuable time would be much better spent rewatching The Nightmare Before Christmas.  [b]3.5/10[/b]",1557790083,False

76561197965929511,"I like Don't Starve. I'm not sure how playing with online randos was supposed to enhance the experience, tho. In Don't Starve Together I spent 75% of the time dead, not knowing about the differences--or more often, because everything around the entrance was picked except seeds & flowers.  ""Git gud"" isn't helpful once you are already dead on the two ""Newbie Friendly"" servers with anyone playing. I will try private with friends sometime, but I see no reason to play with randoms. Community was as helpful and friendly as in LoL. I see DS as a roguelike, or like an old NES game: learn from your deaths. But for DST the best way to learn is to research? No thanks. I buy games for fun and discovery, not so I can rote memorize what others figured out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not faulting the difficulty. Difficult is great when one can insert another quarter and start over. But, if you die in DST you just sit there, not playing the game until others find time for you. People you've just met who are already annoyed that they are getting brain drained have to come rescue you.  My final complaint is that the loading screens are too way too long. Even just the list of servers takes over two minutes to come up. In DS loading took a bit (meaning I know this laptop is an underperformer), but nothing like in DST.   If I could go back I would have bought Oxygen Not Included on sale instead of the DS bundle. O2NI is in early access and it's massively fun!

76561198069781492,"Having played only ten minutes of Ricochet I can assure, without a microgram of uncertainty, to anyone of any background, that the interactive experience known as ""Ricochet"" is the cornerstone of Human achievement in the arts--nay--the peak of man's consummation itself! I see myself to be perpetually indebted to whatever deity unfurled the momentary lapse and position in which not only is this masterwork accessible, but also that I dwell in the juncture of living among the virtuosos who gave birth to the interactive marvel. How might a single mind solicit to inspect such a transcendent monument? Be forewarned, dear reader, that I, nor any man, could possibly hope to dissect a work of this calibur by his lonesome. Hell, I refuse to consider that an array of one thousand strong could decipher it! However, similar the prodigies that created it, I can only hope to muster the copious amounts of genius pouring from this work and cram it into the confines of the english language.  Upon initiating ""Ricochet"", you are greeted with so much symbolism to consume that most average citizens of our realm would choose to exit such a dense and meaningful screen. It is too much to the man with an anemic consciousness. I hardly know where to start when considering bringing this knowledge to the common people. I shall begin with how the work addresses the aboriginal of life and nature itself--birth. The anterior screen showcases many images, one of which tends to dominate the human's attention, as it is the most leviathan icon currently viewable. The gargantuan circle adorned by futuristic glows and structures is a symbol for the birth of the individual, as well as the birth of man into the technological age. Allow me to elaborate. The neo-digital ring depicted is an obvious allusion to the birth canal that nature devised each human to pass through. ""Ricochet"" proves this by how close up to the circular (or rather, somewhat polygonal) shape the art goer is. The moment is almost demonstrated as if your head is about to pass through, yet you are not quite out yet. You, dear reader, may be asking ""Well, if it were the birth canal depicted, why isn't there a light on the other end? Isn't that usually how the birthing process is shown?"" Well dear reader, you are absolutely right! Keen observation of yours, if I do say so myself! However, this is clearly intentional coinciding the entirety of ""Ricochet""'s premise. You see, ""Ricochet"" proposes that in a rapidly advancing digital age, you are born into as much shadow as you were conceived in originally, hence the futuristic design of the configuration. Whether or not the craftsmen of this piece intended to imply that we are merely headed in that direction or we have already lived this concept is entirely disputable. There is much, much more to discuss about this object, but for now the picture requires more context, so I shall leave it at that. Moving on to the next point of interest, another image stands out. Yes, the icon associated with the game's title (to be discussed later)--the feature's logo. On first observation, one may assume the logo is but a relapse of something straight out of a 1980's film--font and all. Be that as it may, the visual holds a profound connotation. When the logo is rotated 180 degrees, the image appears to imitate the lower section of a triangle! Of course! Now, as you would assume from such a work, this holds a variety of nuance. However, I will discuss my interpretation of the logo's meaning. You see, the bottom of a triangle can be associated with the masses. The largest in number, yet trampled upon by its aristocratic counterparts. A classic case of the proletariats versus the bourgeoisie. The logo attaches itself with the work--""Ricochet"". Clearly, the masterpiece's author's intended to represent the common man. Not only that, but the logo suggests something more, as it is rotated so the bottom of the triangle is at the top, The rotation confronts the idea that this piece will give the proletariats the power to overthrow the few that control them and restore power back to mankind itself. While this has not happened, I presume that the craftsmen who administered ""Ricochet"" assumed that would happen. That is one of the major reasons for the game's futuristic settings, after all. ""Ricochet"" shall not bring light to the people until technology and the people have collided with one another, allowing the work's true power to disseminate. Such tenacity bequeaths my soul optimism for our posterity. What beauty to behold, the day ""Ricochet"" provides its rightful nectar to the dry third eyes of the public! Excuse me, I got a tad passionate there. Yet, the principal still stands. I digress, there is more to discuss, and so little allotment for one lifetime! The next immensely abstract element of ""Ricochet""'s title card are its four options. Of course, an important element to any interactive piece: choice. ""Ricochet"" insinuates that any choice you make can be boiled down into four simple decisions: ""Find, Create, Options, and Quit"". Allow me to elaborate on each of those phrases. Find--discovery, you choose to make a journey of some kind to quench your nature-given curiosity. You may not only find what is on the outside, but also evaluate what is on the inside. Create--to craft, to make something of your own. To use your abilities to craft your own solution to any problem. To create is to show yourself to others, much like the artists of ""Ricochet"". Options--to alter or change how you will solve a problem. You may not solve the solution in the most efficient way, but by changing how you operate, you can avoid any negative feedback one may receive. And finally, quit--to cease, to make null any progress of your heart and mind. To stop evil, or to stifle good. The most threatening and harsh choice of them all. Each of these choices can be intertwined with one another, yet they each build a unique experience. Moving along with my simple observations, the first two options specifically state the word ""Server"", along with ""Find"" and ""Create"". It's my humble opinion that the word ""Server"" serves as an opportunity for the creators to manifest a dissection of religions and their deities and how they are found by many people, and how each and every one of them was also created by many people. A ""server"" is someone who, well, serves another man. Many look to gods as mere reflections of mankind, showing them as forgiving or blessing, rather than a lonesome creator of all. The authors of ""Ricochet"" point out the obvious irony that humankind tends to worship themselves when establishing religions based around gods. These deities, while on a surface level they are higher than humans, are merely there to serve as a torch to show man its way. ""Ricochet"" shows these two options alongside one another to demonstrate how comedic and silly the concept of religion seems to be. While you may not personally agree with those statements (and I may not as well), it is the view of mankind that the work builds. True or not, the work still stands. While there are many more avenues of the starting screen, one man cannot possibly see them all. I, for one, cannot hope to understand every concept displayed. Therefore, I must continue my analysis.  Without getting into the still immensely compact consequences for selecting one of the phrases, the systems of ""Ricochet"" hold a host of implications. First off, you, the player, control a clearly hominoid individual. You represent a member of the public. A representation of the base of the triangle of class, as discussed earlier. In this future, you are pitted against another bipedal combatant, to serve as entertainment for the bourgeoisie. There is no other explanation of the ridiculous colours you are adorned with. It's an allegory for a sport, two opposite teams compete against each other to entertain--  Wait, I'm running out of space! I'm afraid that's all I can say... don't be fooled, I-",1514826512,True

76561198013135239,I started playing this and got addicted without ever playing the singleplayer version. It was a blast. Then you learn everything and its just easy to play. The hardest part of this was other players and also the easiest part not actually the game itself. You want to get far in this game you need to learn from others since this game doesn't explain shit. Everyones fights over resources to get first and fights over bosses to fight. Because its not very challenging and usually 1 person can boss alone. Taking DS and not compinsating for other players by adding more resources/biggermaps/strongerbosses kinda just makes 1-2 people have fun while the rest get to be bored. Most people end up throwing in mods to keep themselves from dying of boredom and the only official servers are full 90% of the time. So playing without mods/or weird level settings you need to usually start your own server. That being said if you've never played DS before your going to have a blast. You want more of a challenge play DS. I would recommend DS over DST for singleplayer but i can't recommend DST for multiplayer for a DS experience. The only thing i can recommend it for is lootboxs and skins grinding away for those can really waste your time if your bored.,1517350030,False

76561198146091547,"Love the original game but the Forge is another beast entirely. It takes quite a while just to find a group to get started for some reason, many people are bouncing from lobby to lobby and the quickmatch system elimatinates the chance of looking for specific players/levels. It also appears to have a much more toxic and low effort community than what you typically find in DST since the Forge is a much more forgiving/shorter game mode.   On the subject of low effort, the encounter itself isn't particularly difficult but most groups don't even get close. It looks like most players have never played a multiplayer dungeon game before and don't care to understand or execute simple concepts/strats and would rather just mash the attack button and cry for heals.  I assume the idea was to warm up more of the casual playerbase to approach more difficult, fun and well-scripted boss content in the regular DST game. Unfortunately the execution appears to be just plain terrible in the way that lobbies are set up and players are distributed ie. the quick-match system. The weapon and armor skill kits also leave something to be desired.  These issues really need to be addressed asap since the way the Forge UI is now integrated with DST seems like there's something rotten in an otherwise beautiful product. Also I believe the artwork is beautiful and should be monetized but the skin UI and lootbox system is awful to use and just looks below KLei.

Conclusion: Klei leaves it to the players to create a player friendly environment where you can interact in a sufficient way (discord, teamspeak) and find friends (Klei forums, steam groups etc.).

76561198044801998,"TL:DR This game will kill you endlessly for your ignorance without ever explaining what went wrong or why. Don't play it.  Absolutely do not play this game, UNLESS you have played the normal Don't Starve. Why? Because this game expects you to be a master of the original (because adding this feature to the original game was just too hard and making money off people is great).  I'm known for enjoying a challenging game with friends. But this game is not a challenge, it's just a constant death sentence. Even after having learned as much as I could from wiki's and friends who love Don't Starve, I always found myself dying. It just isn't fun to die because you're ignorant of something that you can't possibly learn without cheating or using a wiki. Not saying I need my hand held, but just being told that this item is going to vanish from the face of the earth in the next few minutes would have been nice to know.  Those of you that enjoyed the original game, play this with random people on public servers or play with other friends that have beaten Don't Starve. Do -not- try to get friends that have never played the normal version to play this unless you plan to force feed them information for 12 solid hours. (That might not even be enough).   Pros It's popular enough to find plenty of random public servers. It's a lot like the original game (so I've been told). It seems simple. The game has an easy interface.  Cons Every character is either brokenly good or dies incredibly easy. (Yes, I did say everyone.) Rogue-like deaths with no rewards. (You die, game over, that's it.) (CORRECTION: You get vanity clothes... Woohoo?) No tutorial, guide, or in game help of any kind. (Get ready to read a lot of wiki's) Difficulty increases dramatically over time, making joining a server a day or more old completely pointless. (Instant death if joining in the summer or winter.) Perma deaths on servers. (Many public servers are forgotten because people spawn in a die on the spot.) (CORRECTION: You can roll back time one day, according to @Egg. Never seen this used though.) Even after tens of hours of gameplay, expect to keep dying after only a few hours in a new world. (Why are you still reading this? Just walk away from this game already)",1500434306,False

76561198348495130,"First off, it'll say this review was posted in 2017. Well I've changed my mind at this point and time. Just... read if you want to find out the horrible truth.. This game. Oh boy. Don't Starve Together is an amazing game, with developers that care so much about the game that they don't patch bugs that have been in for 4 years and literally break the ga- heh, anyways, it's still a very enjoyable experience overall, but I had just experienced the most disturbing thing I'll possibly ever see. I absolutely cannot recommend this game just due to the chance that this might happen to anyone else.  Ok, so, there is a character in the game named Wigfrid who is a battle warrior and mostly has to hunt for food. So I was just hunting right, in the middle of a desert, just waiting for that delicious koalefant to soon be in my stomach. But, well, there is also a 5% chance something much more terrifying can spawn. And I was one unlucky warrior that night. The ""Varg"" (swedish for Wolf) is a massive Wolf that summons its other wolves to aid it in combat. It's truly an overwhelming enemy. Well, before I knew it, I was completely surrounded by hounds. But something was wrong.  The Varg deeply stared at me, and the hounds just kept barking. Usually after about 3 barks they attack. Well, all I had at the moment was like, some grass and twigs in my pocket and the Wigfrid character's battle spear and battle helmet. The hounds suddenly just darted in and carried everything I had away in their mouthes... keep in mind this whole time I was alone and in the middle of a desert. Well, within just a few more seconds, they tore off my skin ""Shadow Armor"". It's just a skin so not actual armor. Anyways, not much longer I was tackled by the mighty Varg itself. I knew I should have died at that moment. But life just kept going at me, huh?  You can probably imagine what happened right after that. So much was going on, I, I didn't know what to do. It was only about 30 seconds in that I had the entire scence scarred into my mind. Some time later my character just completely got knocked out, which I'm assuming was from deleriousness from the extreme pleasure. My character woke up the next morning with all the stuff I had next to me. Well, my hunger was full at least. I came back to the base very ashamed that day. Pretty much everyone laughed at me, some took screenshots. It was horrid, but nowhere near as horrid of what had happened yesterday. Sigh. Even Wigfrid was groggy, started looking like she was crying later.   Well, all in all, this game is what happens when developers make something good and decide to completely ruin it from just one thing. And yes, I know, you do not have to hunt in the game. But at one point in time, you'll go hungry and no one has food. It'll be your only chance really. And just the chance, that 5% chance of getting that image burned into your head.

There is no skill involved in it. If it at least was a bit like Zelda A link to past it could have been far more fun. Build an iron armor or wood armor as quickly as possible btw. But the best way to combat spiders is just by using traps.  Various things are a bit unreasonable. Like food. Why do I need to eat 8-7 steaks to fill up my hunger to max? Do you really eat 7-8 steaks per day? You can eat so many roasted berries without getting full either. It's kinda ridiculous.  Why does the temperature gets to freezing during rain in spring when the normal temperature was 27 celcius? Also why can't I just build a shelter to stay under? Also why does it rain for what seems like 3-4 full days?  Why do I need to use poop for every plant I plant?    Overall it really isn't all that fun.

One in particular is the 2d powerhouse Terraria. I really wanted to enjoy Don't Starve. I had seen the Totalbiscuit review of this game ((that part where he hunts for manure LOL!!)), and thought the game had looked interesting at the time. However, I had clearly not had paid too decent attention to the review.. when we fired the game up, my laptop, his pc, we began chosing characters. To which poses the question.. Why are there no african american characters? Is it coicidental that the actual only ""dark"" character happens to be a monster, aka, the spider? It's 2017 now, and in this climate of change, you would think that the indie game scene would be the first to change. I've seen some games take charge in the war against racism and white privelege, but this is a survival game, which strives for REALISM. In an apocalyptic setting, there would be african americans. There would be latinos. There would be muslims, and anyone else.. Not just white people. I saw the available characters and I told him to shut it down. We decided to play l4d2 instead, a survival game with actual minds put behind it. Take some responsibility, you are the face of a generation. You can make the change, if you have an open mind, open heart, and bravery. It's a shame that so many these days do not though.",1485944884,False

Each season is different from eachother, meaning different tempatures, different bosses, different enemies and mobs, depending on seasons. There are also caves and ruins that you can explore! And of course, they have lots of different treasures! You can also get in-game drops, which are purely cosmetic and do not give any benefit to the player other than cosmetic reasons. You do not have to spend a dime in game, you can just play normally and gain drops by playing! Which is an another plus.

76561198864095457,"One of my favorite games. Strong mechanics especially survival ones in an industry studded with survival games where survival is more of an annoyance than a strength. It took me around 500 hours to really start to feel like I was good, and I can't wait to see what else the game throws at me.   Outside of that, the graphics are very stylised and fit the theme and feel of the game, and the devs have taken simple mechanics like kiting and cooking and made them into something really special that most games don't give you.   Overall 8/10 due to some issues with Maxwells nose being way too small and the community being way too nice.  Try not to starve :)",1578806769,True

Honestly before I even go into detail, buy the game if you love not only the art style, but the survival genre in general. This game does have some flaws, such as the occasionally crash or connectivity issues, but for the most part, Klei have made an amazing thing with this. If you're a fan of the original Don't starve and it's gameplay, then you will feel right at home here. However, your home is no longer an issue.  Now your house is full of your friends and even some strangers, how'd they get here, allowing you and the others to either work together or against each other. For the most part the player base is very nice to each other. Of course some people won't be a saint, but very few people will be mad if you're a new player. While playing online, if someone joins my server that is new I teach them the basics and let them discover the game for themselves.  The items in the game are a nice addition of character cosmetics. Now this is not a perfect game and isn't for everyone, but if you are curious about this game, my advice is to try it. This game is something fun to do and meet people on. The survival is refined and keeps the player engaged and planning with its in game seasons. Overall, this game is definitely a 8.5-9/10. This game is the survival game to just hang out and relax on with your friends. The key is to never really worry about ""playing the game wrong.""

76561198171111282,As far as survival games go this is one of the better ones in my opinion. Unlike Minecraft this game's difficultly very much increases when night falls thus making defense preparation and strategy making a much higher priority. This coupled with the hunger and sanity levels being a core focus of the game and directly effecting gameplay makes it quite an enjoyable experience. I also found the Seasonal Changes to be quite an enjoyable element of the game limiting what resources are available and can be collected at any given time. In addition the multiplayer feature of the game is solid and with the game's lower system requirements it can be played on any modestly powerful IBM Compatible PC. So for those of you who want a fun strategy/survival game you can play with friends I'd say it's worth your time and money.,1578527905,True

She's not a gamer at all, so I needed a more simple game that would be fun for her while also being challenging for me, but that I wouldn't have to just carry her through it.  We just got it recently, but this game has been great for that. It's simple enough with the scavenge and build mechanic that it's pretty easy to understand. I take over more of the combat which can be difficult at times, especially when you both get swarmed. Overall, it's a great game to play together, especially since we're long distance.

I have not played the new ""Return of Them"" update though it looks to have expanded the end game. [h2] The First 20 Hours [/h2] Don't Starve Together begins at its best: as a treacherous adventure.  Building a routine, discovering the behavior of strange creatures, and responding to unseen events slowly increases your confidence that you can beat your previous record.  However, you will likely die due to a lack of preparation every new season.  I believe that this stage of the game holds up for both solo and group players. However, be careful how you build your group.   [b] An experienced player should not introduce a new player to this game [/b].  My attempts to have new friends join result in me warning them of the dangerous surprises that are supposed to be overcome.  It is obviously much more fun mismanaging your base and starving together than having someone tell you how to play. [h2] 20 - 60 Hours [/h2] During this stage, it was important to me that I played with a group.  Routine days, where you could just chat with friends, are punctuated by engaging encounters.  At this stage, the nuances Klei have filled their world up with begin to surface.  Some of these details can be utilized to expand your base and some just make the world feel richer. [h2] 60 Hours & On [/h2] This game has a lot of content and I already got a lot of hours.  However, you know you're not going to die unless you start taking risks at this point.  If you're planning on dominating your world, then there is still a lot of content.  However, I was really only interested in overcoming the survival challenge. [h2] Conclusion [/h2] Don't Starve Together was one of the best games I've played.  I suggest you find at one person who has the same level of experience in the game as you and you'll get more than your money's worth.",1578512034,True
