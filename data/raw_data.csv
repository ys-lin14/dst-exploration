You can build a home base, food and material farms, traps for mobs trying to kill you, clothes to help you survive summer and winter among many other nifty things!

Seasons have different effects on your world such as different mobs acting based on the current seasons, in summer wild fires can occur but fear not as you can protect your base by building ice throwing machines!

Mine rocks for ore for your base and tools but beware meteor fields! One hit and you're dead...

The fun is doubled in multiplayer mode with friends as many crazy things tend to happen... Trust me on this one!

Overall a very recommended purchase you will (most likely) not regret!

Also:
Exterminate beefalo herds with traps and be the bad boy!

- you have to keep your sanity (or you will be insane and stupidly fighting shadows which cannot be seen by your friends. Believe me it's stupid to see someone randomly hitting the air and running around to avoid shadows.
- keep yourself healthy
- stay out of darkness
- make yourself warm during winter
- make yourself dry during the rainy days
- and fighting random monsters coming to your way

It is a good survival game with cute graphics and i fell in love the moment i first tried the game.

Moreover it is quite easy to play it with friends! You can host your game for free and ask your friends to join or vice versa. Just make sure both of you have sufficient internet connection so all of you could play well and have fun.
Or you could just join some dedicated server and meet some strangers out there! Believe me the community is nice and i had a good time playing with some strangers.
