You can build a home base, food and material farms, traps for mobs trying to kill you, clothes to help you survive summer and winter among many other nifty things!

Seasons have different effects on your world such as different mobs acting based on the current seasons, in summer wild fires can occur but fear not as you can protect your base by building ice throwing machines!

Mine rocks for ore for your base and tools but beware meteor fields! One hit and you're dead...

The fun is doubled in multiplayer mode with friends as many crazy things tend to happen... Trust me on this one!

Overall a very recommended purchase you will (most likely) not regret!

Also:
Exterminate beefalo herds with traps and be the bad boy!

Day 5: Attempt to recover stuff, but host turned up trees and grass so the fire doesn't stop.

Day 6: Turns out a Willow was on stalking us and lighting stuff on fire near us. We all die
