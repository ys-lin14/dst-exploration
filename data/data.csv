76561198056008417,"Easily the most enjoyable game I have ever played. Each time you start a new world you make it slightly further than you did the last time only to die to a new aspect that you never knew before. Takes several times to get a mechanic, but once you do the you can finally start learning the other aspects of the game such as crafting and fighting.

76561198203353442,"Don't starve together is a single or multiplayer survival game with a neat graphical style and gameplay.  You can build a home base, food and material farms, traps for mobs trying to kill you, clothes to help you survive summer and winter among many other nifty things!  Seasons have different effects on your world such as different mobs acting based on the current seasons, in summer wild fires can occur but fear not as you can protect your base by building ice throwing machines!  Mine rocks for ore for your base and tools but beware meteor fields! One hit and you're dead...  The fun is doubled in multiplayer mode with friends as many crazy things tend to happen... Trust me on this one!  Overall a very recommended purchase you will (most likely) not regret!  Also: Exterminate beefalo herds with traps and be the bad boy!

76561198055891175,"I had a lot of fun playing this one with my friends. It can be completely unforgiving when you die (the default setting for servers is game over once everyone dies) or you can set it to be resurrected by clicking on the portal (endless). You can run around collecting things and trying not to die. The customization of how many of everything spawns in a server determines how easy or hard the game is and makes for good balance based on player experience level. The developers are consistently working on new DLC and content so it's worth coming back to. There's plenty of enemies to fight and things to build. There's seasons with different challenges to overcome (winter requires warm clothing, summer requires things to cool you off, etc). Mods are easy to implement into the game and keep the replayability high. Overall, a pretty decent game to play by yourself or with a bunch of friends.",True

Some people have created characters but have caused an error for the game in which it does NOT allow you to start up the server. But they tried to comprhend that with a bolt in the corner, meaning that the mod needs fixing or is going to change up your game. Overall I'd give it a 9.8/10.0",True

I also like that you cna host a server and still play buy yourself so if you can't get the original game you can tide yourself over that way.

The game starts you off with nothing forcing you to collect everything to build tools and other things. Its a pretty hard game at first surving a few weeks is a huge challenge as you learn more about the game the way you play improves and you last longer each time. Its amazing to get on and have your own adventure with friends or people you have never met just beware of the willow trolls. Overall i'd say this game is pretty amazing however there are a few lag and bug issues that will probably be fixed over the next few updates I'd say its a great experience for anyone who likes survival games.",True

I decided that I might as well, seeing as it would be good tutorial for me, and hey, I got to spend time with my friends.  Little did I know that the experience was going to become a gateway drug. Ever since, I've been so interested in the characters, the story, the function, the play experience... It sucked me right in, and it's such an immersive experience with quirky characters and equally terrifying mobs.  The Klei Development team themselves seem to be active in he community, on their forums, at least, actively working on updates and bugs, should one ever come up.  The only thing I might add is that... perhaps a DST rendition of Adventure Mode could be added for additional challenge. I can see that being loads of fun. And perhaps more story to reveal?",True

76561198094403643,In this reveiw I will be talking about the pros and the cons of the game and why I think the pros outway the cons. So the game is basically a multiplayer online game where the point of it is to go as long as you can without getting killed or dying in some way shape or form. The biggest fault of the game is it gets boring after a few hours so be sure to give mods a chance if you dont like the game itself. The biggest pro of the game is that it is great for having a good time with friends and working together. Overall I think this game is a great buy for anyone who likes survival games. I give this game an 8 out of 10.,True
76561198147246131,"Each day counts. If you don't work together, chances are you won't survive once autumn ends. If you're not ready for each season, you won't last the full cycle. Each season has a different problem of their own, whether it'd be frostbites, wetness, or extreme heat. The availability of mobs also changes with each season, giving some variety of items and mobs to work with. It's best if you've played on your own first to learn where everything is and how they work before playing with others. This is not a game where you can wing it on the fly.",True

76561198144092464,"Don't starve together. As a name suggest the main point of the game is simple, you have to avoid of getting you (and your friends) starving 😁. However there is much more challenges than the starve, which are: - you have to keep your sanity (or you will be insane and stupidly fighting shadows which cannot be seen by your friends. Believe me it's stupid to see someone randomly hitting the air and running around to avoid shadows. - keep yourself healthy - stay out of darkness - make yourself warm during winter - make yourself dry during the rainy days - and fighting random monsters coming to your way  It is a good survival game with cute graphics and i fell in love the moment i first tried the game.  Moreover it is quite easy to play it with friends! You can host your game for free and ask your friends to join or vice versa. Just make sure both of you have sufficient internet connection so all of you could play well and have fun. Or you could just join some dedicated server and meet some strangers out there! Believe me the community is nice and i had a good time playing with some strangers.

Not going to lie, some of the difficulty (especially the bosses) are kind of a notoriously annoying threat to deal with, and in return you don't get that good stuff. It's definitely really, really fun to play with friends, and the mod support is excellent. however, finding your friends is extremely difficult...  summer is also a huge pain, and so is fire. certain items help prevent things but the method of acquisition (if you don't mess with the settings) is kind of very late game, despite seasons coming and going quickly.T here are certain methods that make restoring things, but there's just so much going on, it feels like a clutter of things.

And oh boy, it was - and still is - one of the most special and interesting, as well as fun and challenging multiplayer games for me to play, even tho I mostly played in co-op.  The game doesn't differ much from the original ""Don't Starve"" except it's on multiplayer mode, featuring the possibilities of surviving in a small group - with or against other players... This means it's the same survival background and the same game mechanics, which is great since ""Don't Starve"" already features loads of great content and pretty much offers you a great singleplayer which you now can enjoy with many of your friends or strangers! Surviving in the mysterious and dark world of ""Don't Starve"", hunting down monsters from the ""Reign of Giants""-DLC and (probably soon) exploring the beautiful iles of the ""Shipwrecked""-DLC is a challenge in the original game, and it still is in the multiplayer - but it doesn't feel as lonely, and for me (peronally) it's one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had!  Thus I strongly recommend you to buy this game if you like the singleplayer or if you're interested in survival games with a multiplayer in general! If you have neither the single- nor the multiplayer you should check out the ""Don't Starve MEGA PACK"" - it's really worth the money, especially if it's on sale!

76561198074644085,"This game receives a lot of credit from the start of my review for being so incredibly unique. Allow me to begin with a brief yet relevant tangent: the ever-growing community of gamers in today's technologically advanced society has brought about more and more games being produced with each passing day. And as great as that is, a lot of these games have begun to look the same. Call of Duty, Battlefront, Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, they all satisfy the exact same prerequisites to create a wartime, pro-America, FPS videogame, and they all appeal to the exact same audience. I'm not saying these are bad games by any means; as a matter of fact they are each highly successful franchises in their own regard. All I'm saying is that they're all too similar to one another. After playing just one, I get the point. Shoot the bad guys, dont let them shoot you. There's nothing noticeable enough to distinguish them from their competitors, but the demand for such games is large enough that they can share the market.  Now back to the review: Don't Starve is NOT one of these games. And that's why I love it so much. It almost categorizes itself into its own genre, and I applaud that endlessly in this day and age. The permadeath feature of the game is frustrating to the novice gamer for obvious reasons, but there are in-game settings to adjust the penalty for dying. The gameplay itself is exhilerating, especially when coordinating strategies among friends (although if you're anything like my friends you'll spend hours screaming at each other over Skype), but that's all part of the fun. The world is vast, and there are lots of areas to explore, enemies to kill, and loot to find and craft. The goal is blatantly simple, but the means of completing the goal are devastatingly complex.   All in all it's a great game at a great price, and it's often times on sale (I bought it for $10).  Two thumbs up!",True

My only complaints are that you loss some of the atmosphere and miss out on underground adventures (for the time being I asume). I play this mainly with my mom. I used the information I gathered from single player and guided my mom through the game. She wasn't interested at first, but loves the game now. The only problem is that they killed the fun of playing as Willow, my mom's favorite character. I prefer Willson because his style works to calm the player and stop you from making recless decisions. That's compared to playing Woody in the past. The game also has problems with workshop mods, but only a few of them.",True

76561198150017206,"Amazing, fun game. Although playing with friends makes it a lot easier, it is still challenging to an extent. As in, you have to find more food, more materials for tools, armor, etc. It is especially hard with multiple people when it comes winter time.    (I find it troubling because of the scarce food supply, and crops not growing because they're frozen over.)  But I do just love playing alongside my friends, and beating monsters that would otherwise be challenging. The downside is that every few minutes, I get disconnected. I'm not sure if it's a bug, or if it's my friend's internet (he hosts). Also, when someone leaves, it still counts them in when the hounds come. Like, if you have your server set to 4 players, and they all join, then 2 leave, it still sends (x) amount of hounds as if the whole 4 players were in the game. Also, I hope multiplayer gets updated, because I would love to play as more characters!  Overall an AMAZING game. I just wish DSTBeta and DS weren't two seperate games.  I recommend it.",True

I like it because there's no major plot or objective to it, than simply -don't die. There are numerous ways your time could be cut short. And your only task is to overcome it. Build, create, struggle, and if you're doing it good enough, thrive.  There are however numerous ways the co-op aspects of the game can be ruined to the point of aggravation. The greatest reason for this is because it is vulnerable to ""griefers"" who destroys everything you've built up (hence why I only play with trusted people, sadly). Another thing being the lack of options for ressurrection early on, in case one of you happens to die. In contrast to the single player version of the game, where you can just restart.

There's no clear instruction of what to do other than don't die, don't starve, and don't go insane - and there's no tutorial.  Often times you'll wander the wasteland finding nothing but rocks and boulders, praying to the merciful gods that you'll soon reach the sabana where you can finally settle down, living from the hunt and start preparing for Winter. Other times you'll find a good spot fairly soon into the game, only to realize that there's no boulders nearby and you're pretty much stuck because you can't build advance structures.  You WILL die, starve, and go insane multiple times before finally figuring out the do's and don'ts. Once you get past this point, you will finally start having fun.",True

76561198003156862,"I bought the Frontier pack for EUR9,99 during a Steam sale and I'm not fully convinced the game is worth this much. I have had fun playing it, the plus sides are:   - Well-working multiplayer (at least I've had zero problems), the server remembers where you left off, easy-to-create servers etc  -Exquisite graphic & sound design with a very distinguished artistic approach. Many people say it's like Tim Burton, but I'm most reminded of a cardgame called Gloom  - Pleasant sound FX  What I do not like:  - The Minimap. I'm guessing it's an early access thing (or maybe not?), but I would like to see where my partner is. I mean, if it's meant to ""make the game more challenging"", it's failing, because we oriented with the Portal (e.g I'm 9 squares south-west of the portal), but it's just tedious and boring. Why not add the other players on the minimap?  - The Minimap - progress. I hate the fact that I'm losing progress when I die. I mean, my character still knows the surroundings, I became a ghost and then was resurrected, right? So how do you justify me losing my memory? Again, it's just tedious.  - The scarcity of resource in some areas. Okay, so I get that it's a survival game and you're supposed to feel ""tense"", but it's a completely different thing if me and my friend spend one entire day looking for ANYTHING edible and we find one berry bush. One playthrough, we went 5 days never meeting a carrot/berries. If you dont have carrots, you cant kill bunnies either with your trap... It's just that sometimes, it became superboring to go through a similar empty landscape. There are so many interesting choices to be made - e.g make a toxic mushroom field, where you have mushrooms that do relieve your hunger, BUT drain sanity or something like that. The tensity disappears quite soon if there is no resources available. Paired with the minimap issues, it becomes excessively annoying, because you need to go far away from each other to scout for resources, but finding each other again (unless your meeting point is the portal), will be very tedious.   Overall, I think it's an enjoyable filler game and probably fills the niche of ""what to play with your girlfriend"" so here's one couple-LAN-party game. But I most definitely think that paying 19,99 for this (even 9,99) is way too much and is definitely not worth it. Wait for a sale or hope for a gift from a friend :)",True

76561198090383305,"I found Don't Starve Together rather enjoyable, it's very fun, and very easy to play. Klei have done an amazing job coding the original Don't Starve into this multiplayer version and it's obvious that they've done a brilliant job doing so. The game itself consists of a 2D/3D background with a cartoonish grey outlook where your aim is to survive as long as possible until you die, depending on whether you have a friend on your game with you, there will or won't be a chance to respawn. If a friend is on with you then he/she can craft a ""Telltale heart"" to bring back a dead player at the cost of 20 health, 3 grass and a spider gland. Dead players cause sanity loss on living players and can roam around ""haunting"" objects and creatures. Perhaps later on as an idea for haunting, the dead player can control the object/animal depending on sanity and having low sanity can allow you to control bigger and more ""alive"" creatures/objects.  Don't Starve Together also brings the concepts from Reign of giants into the game, such as the actual ""giants"". These giants seem to be seasonal with ""bearger"" at autumn, ""Deerclops"" at winter, ""???"" (or goose/moose) at spring and ""Dragonfly"" at summer. These Giant enemies bring a new challenge to players and can bring games to an end because of the high attack damage they possess. This can be a rather difficult challenge for players as giants such as ""deerclops"" can come out of the darkness in winter and destroy your base/encampment.    Don't Starve Together also brings new characters and character concepts into the game, such as ""Wigfrid"" a warrior woman who can only eat meat and has her own character locked weapon and armor called the ""Battle Spear"" and the ""Battle helm"", I found this very useful and fun to be able to use a new weapon which won't bring down sanity, however the character itself can be rather restrictive as when I played as ""Wigfrid"" I felt as if I were restricted to my base as I could not wander too far from my food source which was rabbit traps. Perhaps ""Wigfrid"" could eat food and it would be more filling so that it makes up for the fact that if there is was little meat left the character won't die so fast of hunger and allow for players such as myself to be able to explore without too many restrictions.   ""Webber"" is another addition to the game and is described as (""Is a monster, befriends spiders, grows a silky beard"") he is a very good addition to the game and grants a bigger freedom in the game as the character can eat a wider variety of foods such as monster meat, which I found as a brilliant idea for a character. The character itself though get's attacked by ""Pigs"" if the character gets in a close proximity and this can be very repetitive and persistent, this is a good idea at best but perhaps the character ""webber"" could just be unable to befriend ""Pigs"" and just instead of being attacked just avoided.  Overall I found the game very enjoyable and would be happy to see any improvements in the game such as previously stated and caves which I'm sure Klei are working hard on.",True

76561198332529760,"The epitome of Chaos  Day 1: My friends and I coup at spawn, and rummage our surroundings for resource. Kooper begins as WX-78, he's quite new to the game. Jacob goes for Webster, he's new as well, but knows that guides exist. I go for Willow, I'm the most experienced player of us all.  Day 3: After my friends nearly starve and I've gained 31 gold, we rendezvous at the Florid Postern to scour the darkness with a camp fire, followed by a science and alchemy machine. Numerous threats are administered between my friends as I plan for what's to come  Day 6: I successfully implement 2 farms into our settlement, and a bee box follows a few minutes later. It's not much, but it's a minor amount of regenerable food.  Day 12: We're beginning to have food issues. 3 mouths isn't easy to feed with such a small area to rummage around, especially with such a slow revitalization rate that the plants have. To make it worse, Glen, another friend, joins the server. He plays as Wendy.  Day 13: At dusk, we hear them. The hounds. They're dead, and I'm left with 13 health. Just before the cloak of night, 3 claps of thunder can be heard in the distance as they revive at a touch stone.  Day 16: Jacob is having lots of trouble with maintaining his sanity. Numerous times he has hit single digits, and nearly ended this escapade if I hadn't had Bernie.  Day 19: We're all starving, and the long nights that keep us stuck around the campfires isn't certainly helping. Winter is on the horizon, and we're not prepared what so ever.   Day 21: The first morning of winter, the snowbirds appear. Things head south, we're freezing, and Willow's inability to stay in the cold is certainly crippling my abilities.   Day 23: We've run bankrupt, there's nothing left. Then the thought hits me as my friends fight for the last monster lasagna cooking in the crock pot, the caves. They're our only hope.  Day 24: Our sanity is barely anything. I'm on the brink of 20, and the rest have single digits. Jacob has officially reached 0 sanity. We make our run to the nearest clogged sinkhole, I have to stay back to keep myself warm with a forest fire from my lighter.  Day 26: We've set up camp in the caves, and things aren't going well. Jacob, as Webster, is exiled by the nearby pack of rabbit men, and has to live in isolation. He dies mere minutes later as darkness envelopes him and his base. There isn't any hope of revival, with no touch stones or spider glands to use, he's done until we reach spring.  Day 29: They're all dead, they starved. It's only me. I shouldn't have eaten that lightbulb, should I?  Day 30: Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. 0 sanity. My days are numbered.  Day 34: I make a stance with only 2 days left until I can return to the surface. I'm so close, I just have to keep this up for 2 more days.  Day 35: I try to regain sanity, staying as close to the fire as possible with my rotting garland onto of my head. Bernie fends off the darkness as the spiders crusade upon the rabbits that provide my second sense of defense.  Day 36: I'm free, It's time. Winter is over. At least, I think it is.  I make my way to the surface. Bad decision. A group of snowy hounds have been waiting vigilantly at the gates to the surface. Turns out day 36 was the last day of winter, not the first day of spring.  I die, I have no defense, no sanity, and no direction of where to go beyond this point.  We lasted 36 days. Enjoy.",True

You are going to die. A lot. Whether it be to starving, to the darkness, to your own insanity, or even to spiders. Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand. But you get better, you learn from your mistakes, and you overcome your weaknesses.   I rarely play online with strangers, but with a group of friends, it is a blast. Huddling together at night, working hard during the day, using your character's strengths to work with those of others, it's so much fun. You build and build until you realise that you're all, in a funny way, a family. A bunch of people stranded and who must work together.   Get this game.

76561198003120308,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for DST yet .. I've only been playing it since it came out! So far, I like it. I need a few more hours played to be absolutely sure, but I think after a little over 3000 hours under my belt that I have figured out, mostly, how not to starve! Klei Entertainment is hands down the best company making games.  They hardly ever disappoint their audience, and if you don't like something, and you tell them about it politely, you'll get a reply explaining things. There are a lot of survival games nowadays, but DST is unique. There is no manual, it is a sink or swim game. And you die at first, over and over again. But there is something about being afraid of the dark that they tapped into. When you first start playing you fear nightfall because in DST, as in it's predecessor Don't Starve, there really ARE things out there that will kill you when night falls. Of course, other things are happily trying to kill you in the daylight, too. There is a lot of fun in the game, and Klei's programmers have a wicked sense of humour and a love of punning! This game has got better and better over the years. Since December of 2014 the Don't Starve universe has consumed a huge amount of my time and I still play one or other version every day. And I still die! But not of starvation.  Edited Nov 26th 2019. After another 450 hours or so, I have to say that I finally learned how to die infrequently. And that I really like this game. I also like the gifts one can get on a daily basis due to the generosity of Klei Entertainment which is still the best games company in business today.",True

The Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.  As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.   If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.  Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently.

With excellent modding support and great devs, this is an absolute no-brainer to get.  10/10 ★★★★★",True
76561198090104888,"Don't Starve Together is a game that I can say quite a lot about even as someone who hasn't played the original Don't Starve. If you are wanting to buy this game, but you intend to only play it by yourself, then I strongly suggest you stop now, don't get this game, and get the original Don't Starve along with its DLCs instead. If you still want to get this game, then I'm just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you'll need to know stuff about the original Don't Starve as well.   You don't need to know the plot of the original game to know what Don't Starve is about. Even though it is a sequel in a way, you don't need to know what happened. Basically, you're going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal, survive as long as you can. There is a lore to the game, and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it's really interesting and ever so more expanding. The world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do, but it's that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it.   Right off the bat, the game spews charm from it. From character and monster designs, to the artstyle, the old vintage look, and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have. I can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme.   You'll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you'll play as, each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other. For players who have already played Don't Starve, you won't have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked, they're all unlocked right out of the gate. Also for players who have played Don't Starve, the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer. Each character fits a different play style so you'll never feel as though you're playing as the same character, and you can feel the differences with each character and you'll find someone with a playstyle who you'll enjoy playing as the most.  This game is not easy and if you are new, you'll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do. The game is not going to teach you anything, you'll either have to learn to survive as you play, learn from other players, or research about the game. At no point are you ever going to be safe. You'll have to eat to keep yourself from starving, find ways to restore your character's sanity so that way you don't go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures, fire can spread and destroy precious resources, some resources can't respawn, some creatures will attack and try to kill you, and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day. Even changing seasons will be a hazard as you'll either have to survive the cold of winter, the storms of spring, or the heat of summer. It may be hard to get into first, but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays, it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to. You'll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you'll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long.  The one thing that stands about this game over the original Don't Starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people. You can play by yourself, but it won't be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the Steam Workshop. If you're going to play this game with others, I highly recommend playing with friends.   If there is one thing I can say about this game is that it will get reptitive. Once you get the hang of the game, it's just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it, you'll have nearly nothing to worry about.   If you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends, this game is definitely for you and I can highly recommend it to others. Even though it can get repetitive after a while, I still find it to be a fun game where you'll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going, and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it, I can see it being supported for a long time.",True

Honestly, the level of dedication the developers have to churning out new content FOR FREE* almost every other month is astounding, especially considering the game has been out since 2016.  Now, to gameplay itself. You will die, a lot, and you'll enjoy it. This game has enough depth to keep you interested for months, and depending on the amount of people you're surviving with, this dynamic will also be different each time. Different character combinations will shift your survival focus to different things.  Also, it's not just a sandbox where you survive to explore a procedurally generated world -- there are certain events to complete, bosses to beat and set pieces to make function and take advantage of, all of them require planning and numerous attempts.   Again, you will die a lot, but preparing for it is a challenge in itself. Building a self-sustaining base with your friends is fun, figuring out ways to beat bosses and survive seasons is fun (I advise you to hold off Youtube and wikis for a while and take pleasure in working out game mechanics yourself).  All in all, this game is a gift that keeps on giving. I strongly recommend the game for all seeking either a casual experience with your friends, or a challenging survival sandbox that has both style and depth to keep you entertained for months.   *bar 2 out of 15 characters, one of which you get for free if you own the Hamlet DLC for the original game.

The difficulty is that those who have played a lot of dont starve have so much more expertese than those who have never played it that it's the equivalent of a wilderness survival guide taking an 8 year old city kid camping.

If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).  Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.

76561198290310711,"[b]**NOTE: This review will be constantly updated to accomadate any changes in my opinion, updates, etc.**[/b]   [h1]INTRODUCTION[/h1]  I heard a lot of good stuff about Don't Starve Together, and I've watched some of my favorite YouTubers play the game. That's probably what drove me to buy it. My friend also happened to have Don't Starve Together, so we could play together. The game definitely isn't as much fun without friends, lemme tell ya.  So the game was fifteen dollars. It seemed like a pretty decent price, and I thought, ""well, why the heck not?"" So, to checkout I go. I had HIGH expectations, and I was worried that since I kind of knew about the game already, I would miss out on the experience of exploring it myself.  Haha... I'm laughing because I was an idiot.   [h1]WHAT DON'T STARVE TOGETHER IS[/h1]  Don't Starve Together has the amazing features of Don't Starve, except it's multiplayer and there's a different story. The art is dauntingly adorable. What do I mean by that? The art sets you into a world about survival and its dangers. I seriously love it. The type of art compliments the gameplay style perfectly, and it makes the game [i]that[/i] much more enjoyable.  You're thrown into an unforgiving world. There are tons of monsters, darkness that will swallow you whole, and lands that will try to kill you. But along with this sparks fascination. You have to survive in a crude world, learning along the way, picking up tips & tricks, and gathering tons of knowledge.  This is definitely my favorite survival game. It has greath depth, it's compelling, and extremely creative. The crafting aspect is fun, and exploring things is just simply enchanting.  The [b]purpose of Don't Starve Together[/b] is to play with friends, and I definitely recommend so. It's much more fun if you play with other people.  I usually recommend buying Don't Starve Together instead of Don't Starve, because in DST (Don't Starve Together) you can play both singleplayer and multiplayer. The only difference is the story. DST's story is a continuation of the original and classic Don't Starve. But honestly, the story isn't as important in my opinion, as the game can be a total sandbox and is much more valuable because it has multiplayer. It's meant more to be a sandbox type game, but the story can be important (it depends on the player).  If you're someone who doesn't play mutliplayer, then get Don't Starve. Otherwise I recommend Don't Starve Together. Even then, there are public servers you can join and play with other strangers.... totally trustworthy.  [h1]PLAYING[/h1]  I really, [i]really[/i] love this game. So far, I've played 130 hours in total. I wasted a lot of time. ([i]A lot[/i]). There's a lot to explore, and with 130 hours... I honestly haven't gotten into half the game yet! I know. I should've by now. But there's a seriously fun aspect with Don't Starve Together that won't let you drop it, and I'm surprised I haven't written this review sooner.  The great part is, there are tons of different mods created by the community that can impact your game. You should really get them. They're awesome, and yes, trustworthy. They're located in the workshop (in case you're wondering). And they seriously make your game much more fun. If you ever get the game and want to know what mods I recommend, please message in the comments below. There are lot of different mods, but there are some extremely important ones that make your game easier and more immersive.  Exploring was so much fun. The whole aspect reminds me of Stardew Valley, but to me there are a lot more things to discover in Don't Starve Together, and with friends it's amazing. You really shouldn't underestimate the game. It has a lot to offer, and is popular for a fantastic reason: it's purely great.  [i]""It's definitely a better game with friends. And it can be spooky & scary, especially if you don't know what's going on (rlly now?). I swear if you write this word for word-""[/i] - Quote from Kuep.   ^^^ He read it. [i]""You're a spaghetti-o-""[/i], he says.  Don't Starve Together is very unique, comedic, and fun overall. Much recommendation. I had a lot of moments where I died laughing, a lot of ""WTF"" moments, and honestly the game is a great excuse to have a good time with your friends. So if you wanna trick people into liking you, play this with them.  [h1]THE PROS[/h1]  - Adorable art. It fits the game perfectly, and you will love it's cuteness.  - Fun characters. Each default character has a backstory and unique personalities and weapons.  - Mods. Mods made by the community that makes your game extremely fun. You will love your life once you get them. Seriously.  - Exploration. Lots o' exploration. Lots o' fun. Enuff said.  - Challenge. The game offers challenges to those who like it, and even with normal gameplay you have to survive hunger and sanity. You can customize your settings to what you want on Don't Starve Together, and I really think that's fantastic.  - Uniqueness. It may have the classic but fun ""survive"" theme, but it has unique gameplay (you'll see what I mean if you buy it. Which you should.)  - Constantly updated. Constantly updated with new and old things from Don't Starve, and that's great. Games that don't update sometimes get boring, but with an alive workshop community and constant updates, that sure won't happen soon.  - Music. It's daunting. It's revving. It's themed perfectly. What more could you ask for?   [h1]THE CONS[/h1]  - Connection issues. Sometimes even though your wifi works on both ends servers get a little laggy, but it doesn't happen that much. Watch out if the person hosting the server has terrible wifi. You will hate them and your life.  - Imcompatible mods. This is not really a con, but it IS something you should be aware of. There are mods in the workshop that won't work with each other, and sometimes they will crash your game. This is annoying because if you subscribe to a lot of mods you have to go through each one to see which is crashing your game. For the most part, most mods are working fine. It's more of the, ""ehhhh""-looking mods that don't work, (which is kind of obvious).  - Sometimes crashes. Sometimes Don't Starve Together has file issues and crashes your game. It happens rarely, but it is something to watch out for. No, none of these crashes deleted any of my progress, which is excellent. The game autosaves quite frequently. (Now that I think about it I've never had to save myself... Wait is there even a manual save button???)   [h1]PLACES TO IMPROVE[/h1]  - Crashes. Please fix file issues that occur randomly. A lot of users do have this, but as I said, it doesn't wipe any progress whatsoever.  - New biomes. I would love if there were new biomes. Something fascinating.  - New items. I would like new items. Once you play the game you realize there isn't that much diversity, but that's where mods come in! Hah. Still please make new items. <3   [h1]DON'T STARVE YOURSELF HESITATING TO BUY THE GAME (I'm bloody hilarious)[/h1]  It's fun as hell, and I had a lot of fun with this game. It is a game where you have to constantly look out for not dying, but there's [i]so[/i] much fun being chased to death by hounds. Trust me. It's a first-time experience. (I don't know if it is for you, though... o_o). And the fact that everyone is screaming that there's a gigantic black flea trying to chomp you (aka, the hounds) makes it all-the-while.  I want to stress about the art, because it really does fit well. I think it's perfectly suitable for the game, and it's extremely likeable as well.  This is a game I definitely recommend. A lot of fun, with challenges, and the great survival aspect I love. It's very original, and the characters are extremely comedic. The game can even be relaxing if you choose for it to be, or it can be freaking death chasing after you every split-second of your existence.

76561198043774270,"Excellent survival game with a unique artstyle and consistenty strange personality. One of the few actually complete survival games, with tons of stuff to discover and run away from!   In this online co op version of the original game, not only do you get to play with friends, but you also get the reign of giants dlc for free! I'm a bit perplexed as to why the original game doesn't have this content as well yet though (included).  In don't starve you do exactly what the title suggests. find food. Food is essentially the most important thing in the game, being the sole reason to venture out and gather things. If you don't keep finding food, you eventually starve. There are plenty of other dangers of course, but ultimately, it's that constant need for food that really makes it a challenge. Wolves? No problem. Giant dragon flies? Peice of cake. Carrots? SHIT WE RAN OUT OF CARROTS.   This game is so much more fun with other people. Sure, it was fun alone, but the dynamics of co op really make it extra fun. Your friend might accidentally provoke an army of pigs to murder them, then you have to go rescue them and you then spend 10 days trying to recover the health and sanity you lost, ultimately crippling your preperation for winter. THAT is the sort of wonderful stuff that can enrich your experience. And obviously, friends aren't always a burden. YOU might be the burden at some point and they get to rescue you. Or you can all share food with eachother. It's just really really fun.   Definitely recommend this game.

76561198005925420,"I'm not a fan of the genre. Those multiplayer craft-based, survival sandbox games just don't appeal to me and neither the notion of playing early access games. But I love me some Don't Starve Together. Klei is slowly becoming my favorite indie studio because they just seem to understand what makes games fun to play, and DST is fun as heck. I liked the earlier game but I always found it too stressful. By playing with friends the tension just seem to evaporate and stumbling upon new and exciting ways to die horribly becomes something we all get a big laugh of. Gather a bunch of friends and play this, it's worth it.",True
76561197967159739,"This is a fun co-op survival game, though game mechanics discourage larger servers.   Dead players bring the 'sanity' of live players down, so on large servers (which are more likely to have a dead player at any given moment), your 'sanity' is threatened more often. Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers.   Communication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.  On top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.  All of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge.",True

However, the lag can be fixed with a simple restart of the server which takes like 2 minutes max -This isn't really a con, I just dont understand it?

76561198014801189,"I've never said how much I love this game to death.  <3  My only real critique of Don't Starve Together are the mechanics of ""together"".  They are not nearly as brutal as the original game, by merit of having help.  It's still a grueling survival game, but on larger games it can get quite well established, to the point where most threats aren't even a concern.  The ghost mechanic is also a little annoying for when you're playing the game socially, and mostly want to just enjoy time with friends, since the optimal course of action for someone who is in ghost form, who can't immediately be ressurected, is to log out of the server.  But aside from these criticisms, I love both the core game and the multiplayer version.  Both are absolute favorites of mine, and continue to stay good, through DLC, keeping them fairly fresh.",True

76561198243221260,"[i]In Don't Starve Together obviously everything is about not to starve, but if that was the only way you could die in this 2D Open World Survival Game it would be kind of boring.. right? Luckily that is not the case because basically anything might kill you if you don't watch out! Various beasts, catastrophes, shadow figures or feeble-minded pigs might cross your way and won't make it easy for you to stay alive in this rough world. So why not invite some friends? The title says it all, other than the Singleplayer: ""Don't Starve"" here you should probably bring some company to explore the world and exist against those horrible creatures. But if it wasn't difficult enough.. the weather won't be on your side for long either. It might be rather challenging to play this Game and there are a lot of mechanics and tricks that make DST unique, but you will need quite some experience to figure them out. The very charming graphics and humor will make you love the Game quicker than you want.[/i]  [u]Characters:[/u] You can select from a lot of different characters for your journey, who all have their very personal Pros & Cons. The specific abilities and weaknesses make the gameplay exciting and miscellaneous everytime again, trust me.. From Robots and Spiders to Scientists and Warrior Valkyries your choice is kind of unlimited (even more and better characters are still developed) and up to you and your fellow survivors.  [u]Base Building:[/u] Of course you can wander around as a Nomad, gather ressources and be on track all the time but the essence to be progressive in DST is to build yourself a base for all your needs, I mean who wouldn't prefer some delicious Meatballs fresh from the crockpot over berries and carrots.. In order to set up your buildings you can't just immediately cobble together some boards and stones like a pig.. You have to invent them before! By the huge variety of items in the Game it won't be easy to obtain them all. So good luck.  [u]Boss Creatures:[/u] Every now and then some more or less scary Meanies will come to destroy your well deserved progress! Better be prepared and packed with armor, weapons and perhaps some magical items to defeat them. *Psst* They also have unique loot which will grant you access to craft cool gadgets or equipments to make your living easier :)  [u]The Caves:[/u] On the one hand there's the actually quite harmless overworld with its rich land but on the other there's also the underground which has a lot of dangerous and scary beasts lurking for you in the darkness! But if you can prevail down there, you will probably be abled to find the magical secrets of the ruins, which should be discovered by yourself. Once you have beaten them you can rule the overworld with your knowledge!  [h1]Skins (and how to get them)[/h1] Yes, here you'll also find those Skins for Items you might already know from other Games ^^ Don't worry.. they're just cosmetic and won't give you any advantage! Besides the advantage of spicy looking characters, tools or buildings. And you can even share the skins on tools or buildings with your friends in-game, so everyone profits from them ;)  You get 1 Skin Drop everyday by logging in and 8 Skin Drops every week by playing (Caution! Science required) Some might be marketable and some might not be, but they look cool non the less :D You can also purchase Skin Collections in the Shop of the Game to support the Developers!

First off, that's like saying ""Castlevania's just Mario with a whip""; the mechanics and overall feel of the two games are completely different. That aside, I love this game. Be warned though, once you boot up this game, you may never see your family or sunlight ever again. You'll probably want to start off playing this game alone, since it's frustrating to have a noob constantly die in the base, and not even know how to play the game.

I personally recommend playing the game for a bit with God mode, and faffing about with the console commands for any newcommers to this harsh game. (I personally recommend using the mod, Too Many Items. It's a very helpful mod that acts as a visual HUD for the console.) ------------------------- Here's a list of things you could try doing: You could try your hand at taming beefalo. You could try taking out some of the Giants. You could gather supplies for those who need it. You could explore the caves. You could raid the ruins. You could traverse the Labyrinth. You could kill the Ancient Guardian. You could battle the Marble Chess pieces on a full moon. You could then battle the Shadow Chess Pieces on the new moon. You could then gather 8 fossil fragments and assemble them in the atrium. You could then fight the Ancient Fuelweaver. After that you could go fight Toadstool. After 20 days, you could go die to Misery Toadstool. And by the time you're ready to do almost all of those, you'll realize that, before you know it, you're on day 200, and it's 5am in the morning, and you have missed a week in school.  ------------------------- All in all, it's a great game, that's more addictive than crack cocaine. Trust me, you'll be saying ""Oh, I'll just continue playing until the full moon, then I'll go feed my kids"", and before you know it, you're on day 1600 and you've been pronounced legally dead.

76561198052179245,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason.   If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed.   Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!

Not everyone on here is nice, in fact you will meet many greifers which is probably the hardest challenge.

76561198035849902,"The multiplayer expansion of the game Don't Starve. The game does a good job if you actually played the original game so you would understand how to actually play. If you and your friends just jump into Don't Starve Together with no context, you're going to be in for a ride(expect lots of dying) Don't let the title deceive you as starving is only one of the many obstacles you will have to tackle in the world of Don't Starve.  pros +Basically harvest moon with death +Has a good mix of farming and combat +Supports modding +Many options for world creation +Audio feedback on actions and events +Friendly community +Can spam chat with emotes and Character gestures +Events that come and go(The Forge being the first dedicated server cooperative event)  cons -World servers are peer to peer which means the host needs to have a decent toaster to support the world -No steam cloud support for game saves(world data, affects host) -No time to for even a break once you start playing(or else you might die, starve, etc) -The dark is scary -There are actually four seasons -Takes a while to convince your friends to play -That turkey eating all my berries -very time consuming which sometimes does not work well in a large group  All in all, this is an amazing game to play with friends. Although the game is worth it's price, it does go on sales often which I do suggest as getting the game for 50% off feels great.

76561198101060738,"Don't Starve Together is a top-down survival game of the original Don't Starve, now with multiple mouths to feed with.   You start off by selecting one of the diverse characters from the Wilson Family and are thrown right into the world. Your job is, as the title suggests, to don't starve and survive the upcoming 4 seasonal periods. As from there it goes on, you craft science machines to invent new things, get clothing to fit into the current circumstances and fight off hundreds of hounds, spiders and giants along your way. If you die, there's no other way to be resurrected except a few rare items or the all-famous Telltale Heart, crafted with the blood of other players (literally).  Pros: This game is harsh. It is full of little things that try to kill you or the other way around, limited resources are almost guaranteed, and let's not forget the seasons. You have to prepare for the upcoming season you are about in to enter, which can be a bit tricky sometimes to get used to. Clothing, Hats or items that help you stay cool, warm and dry are crucial.   The gathering of resources and understanding the core on what to do to survive is satisfying to watch. Having your own base set up with all required farms, chests and structures gives a successful feeling to the player and encourages them to repeat said process, to see if they really got the hangout.   Speaking of base building, this is a good game to play with a friend to that has a basic knowledge. A newcomer can learn fairly easily where the rabbit is going and should get the hang of the survival techniques quickly. It may be confusing on what to do first, so it is always recommended to watch what others do, hence said before that it is good to play it with another friend with basic information.   Immense workshop support. This is a big plus for all the mods out there. They can make your life easier, harder or just add some neat little things that really don't change the core too much but help out a ton.   Cons: The lore of this world you are in is briefly explained as ""statues that stand around"". There is no real way to tell how much the game developed in the story without looking it up online. I wished the lore would be given to you at least a bit while playing.   While the world is easy to jump into, the resource placement can be pretty shady at certain parts. I once had one world where thousands of lizards spawned in the middle of the desert, or one biome wasn't generated at all, even after exploring the entire map for a good solid 10 days.   Seasonal periods last for a long time and aren't something you would play quickly for an hr and then go shut the game off. To get into winter, at least 20 days are set, which are about 2 hours in. It doesn't seem that much but the time can feel stretched out at this point.   Conclusion: A very good survival system with lots of food and magic (as Klei likes to pronounce it anyway)",True

76561198196440895,"游戏本体是好游戏，不必多说 The game itself has got its reputation  如果和同地区基友开开小服玩那是相当欢乐，10/10 If you only play with a few local friends it would be very funny. 10/10 in this part  然而公共多人服务器蛋疼的很，主要原因：太多必须的资源是不可再生的，早期版本的燧石如果你进的晚了，你走遍卡拉迪亚大陆都找不到。石子？你还想找石子？种地狂魔表示种田种不了不能忍。。 However the public servers are muuuuuuuch worse. Main reason : lots of necessary resources are not reproduceable. For instance, flints and stones in early versions. When you get in the serve afterwards, it's almost impossible to play it.  很多一次性资源烧了就烧了，一个Griefer进来整个服全废了，杀牛烧基地烧猪人村的啥都见过 Once a griefer come in the serve, the serve would face a massive catastrophe. He would burn the big houses, the base, kill the buffalos and dig rabbit holes, burn everyone elses' hard work into ashes easily.  新人在冬天或者夏天进服基本必死。然后新手一死，survival服务器马上就炸了，我理解一个人死降所有人san值是为了让大家有羁绊，但是很多新人一进服到处乱转，死了也不说话，所有人都找不到他，大家san值一起疯狂的掉，这使得很多吃san值的角色根本没法用（机器人，图书管理员） If you come in the serve in winter/summer, you are a dead wilson. Once a player dead it would not be a good situation for anyone else in the survival serves. I know the aim of sanity loss for death is to tied up all the members, but there always be someone likes to play alone and once he/she's dead, no one could find him and would suffer a long time.(Usually I quit in this circumstances.) It also cause many characters who have got low sanity rarely seen in the serve, like WX78 and librarian.  这造成服务器的新人友好度低，因为新人很大程度上基本上和破坏者Griefer没什么差别. At last most serves are not welcome the new players and give them little help, cuz unexperienced new players have small differences with griefers.  我很喜欢这游戏，希望能在多人服务器的可持续性上多一些改进。这样才能“一起繁荣”. I love this game very much and I hope in the near future the game would improve in sustainable issues in order to Thrive Together.  ",True

""What's that?"" you think, worrying. You've faced wolves before, killed them even. But these seem...different. As you reach for the spear to your side, you hear the beating footsteps of the pack, drumming their way up towards the light. You tighten your grip around the spear- you are prepared.  Except you really weren't! Dogs jump from all angles towards you, salivating, hungering, desperate for a bite. You slash and spin, killing a few as you go. But...there's a different one. A red one! It runs over, and in a second, one single moment, everything is set ablaze. You watch as your chests, farms, machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time. In your shock and awe, the red dog takes you in his jaws, ferrying you into the darkness. Your body, being devoured, simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash.  ================== A new day... a new chance?  You push through the first 29 days in this hell.

You all look to eachother for answers, but no answers can help now. In the corner of your eye, you see it. Reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire, there is an iris, floating high above the ground. Another tremor rattles the team, and the body of the creature is exposed. A single eye, antlers, a fur coat, and the will to destroy. Time slows down.  You observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature, as it swipes the ground, eviscerating them. Your friends fall to the floor, lascerated with gaping wounds. Blood shoots from their oozing injuries, and the creature laughs, turning its attention to your happiness, your creation. It stomps on the bird cages, uproots the farms, and defecates on your berry bushes, before crushing them inbetween its hand. As the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers, it's eyeball finds its way to you. It stares at you, dropping the pooey bushes.

As I have spent well over 580 hours playing the game, hosting dedicated servers, making mods, playing though-out early access and after release I will tell you what I think of the game that ate up most of my free time.  Pros 1 The game is stable, functional and works well just like don't starve does but only online. The game has a massively active fanbase and after I wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages I have been sent to help people on their server, to help get mods working and to join people in there server. The game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag, but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well. I have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me, running 20-40 mods with many people on a server.   2 The game is modable it runs on  the same code as don't starve on LUA code so if you know how to read basic code, and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game. I have been able to make mods for don't starve and don't starve together although I only published them privately. The game is very easy to mod, hell even someone as shit at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made, crappy, interesting, fun and awful mods you can enjoy. You could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore, or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the don't starve together workshop has.   3 The game is really fun I don't need to say that when I spent over 580 hours in the game do I? Well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content. The combat in the game I would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright. Cons  1  The game made me read and write code. I didn't need to and I didn't want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so I could log out of my own game then rejoin it when I came back. Then I learned stuff like how to write ini files, LUA, batch files, and other codey words I can't remember. That stuff isn't fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game. If you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff.    2 The game doesn't have local multiplayer its possible I even say a don't starve mod have local multiplayer so why didn't they add that into DST? Well I can think of why they didn't they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and that's fine. It still sucks that I can't play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever.  WARNING this game is going to mess with you, first you join a few games then your like ""oh I liked this in this game but I didn't like this in, this game"" then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse. Second, You will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 30-80 mods you can enable or disable in your game. then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods, then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer, then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast, well and you will build a awesome base with other players, have lots of fun but then because PVP is off and the game is public, the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made. You can't kick the scum fast enough and you don't just want to kick them... No you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it. So then you turn PVP on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you. Then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies. Warning this game will change you.   Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, yeah its alright. ",True

First at all, It's an open world game.In the game the protaganist is trapped in an island, you must explore,collect things,learn,fight, and craft to survive there.But how to survive depends on player's choices.So this island is a mini world.You'll do all things there by your will and choices.That's what attracts me most.I like this kind of games,such as Mount&Blade which I have played for 5 years.  Don't starve's art style is also awesome which will make you remember of Tim Burton's movies.and I really love its adorable character design.  It will be challenging at beginning.You will die for many times for many kinds of reasons.You will learn things from every failure.until you've learned enough skills to survive for really long time, you won't feel hungry any more,but you will feel lonely.as you are the only person in that world(only in Don't Starve). ---------------------------------------------------------------- and good thing is,you won't feel lonely anymore,you can play with your friends now.You need to divide the work and cooperate.That may be more interesting than working alone. You can also make new friends by this game.I met a friendly Korean kid.She(He?) played really well and  helped me generously.We talked by translation software.But I can't play with her anymore because of the bad network.",True
76561198255074025,"Stunning art style and unique gameplay. I never like playing survival game because I'm not very good at surviving but this one is different.   This game is just like any other survival games, throwing the player into a world without any instructions but I felt that every deaths is a learning curve that the players learned as they go unlike other games dying from the same thing and never learn anything. Plus not most survival games are third person orientated.   Just like other games, this game also really push you to your limits such as testing your ability, skill, resource spending and time management. You will need to be strategic when you're playing in a harsh world this game puts you in. Planning ahead and praticing in game combat skills if you're one of those hardcore players. Oh yea, there is also PvP for those sociopathy people who killed people for fun.   If you're like me who prefer calm and relaxing gameplay you could play on endless where you are not punished too hard if you died but still keeping survival game vibe.  In the end, I would recommend if you like strategy games, this one would be the one for you. Just before you play I would highly suggest that you go watch some videos and reading wiki before you start playing unless you're like me, entering a gunfight with a knife.",True

76561198417658365,"Famine is one of the few games that makes me scratch my head. It provides many wonderful scenes of death, but to see these unforgettable moments, you need to spend a considerable amount of time each time working hard. In this game, you can spend hours collecting resources, equipping characters, fortifying bases, and ultimately just seeing your little paradise destroyed by an unstoppable group of shadow monsters. The game itself is to explore the risk of survival type, death is inevitable, and when you die, the game is really over. Famine doesn't treat players tenderly, which is the reason why I love and hate it.Klei studio adopted the production concept of My World, throwing players into the magnificent wilderness, how to survive is the player's own to understand. Some adventure gamers like this kind of white paper freedom very much. They can play a day with their patience, creativity and courage. But the lack of any guidance and mission goals in this work will allow you to find ways to survive in the world of Tim Burton's film style, and the Gothic style of painting will make you feel that your life is at stake. Simple stories, novel menus, children's literature atmosphere give people a very strange feeling, but the background music is very happy, and repeated brainwashing, soon let the author have to turn off the game music, play the music list of horrible weird atmosphere.The rules of the game are simple: explore the world, collect materials during the day, light a fire at night, eat, repeat. Although this routine has begun to be a bit vulgar, the hopeless struggle for survival brought about by the game is very strong. In a game process, the author found that the food was almost eaten, and was chased by a group of spiders running in the woods, the author felt that there was no hope, so he broke the kettle and sank the boat, facing the wind, set a tree on fire, soon, the whole forest was on fire, the spiders chasing me were also baked into silk, and then I used it. These silks make a dress.After a while, my character was exhausted and I lost my sense, when I was weak and let a little frog attack me, and eventually died under the frog's mouth. I died peacefully - I could have made some high-tech weapons, but I had lived enough to stay in the world of Famine. No achievements, no scores, only their own stories. Game experience is a reward for players.There are often unfair deaths in the game. There have been several times when the straw was in front of me, but in the end it was not available. Although the side view fully demonstrates the excellent artistic concepts of the game, it often blockades the key items painfully. The characteristic of the forest is that there are many trees here, but often encounter the angle of egg pain. You can never find something hidden behind the tree. When your life value is very low and you are chased by all kinds of creatures, a tree often decides your life and death. After death, it's at least another 30 minutes.The only way to break this cycle of life and death is through the doors scattered around the world, which can deliver you to small adventure missions. Usually the task is to have you look for something with a stick, and a group of monsters will try to eat you. These small tasks complement the plot, but once completed, the player returns to the crisis-ridden world, and still has no sense of accomplishment.Before I start a new game, I hesitate because the first 30 minutes or so of each new adventure are extremely boring and are absolutely repetitive and redundant. Indeed, every time I restart, I explore more recipes for making objects, or the behavioral characteristics of certain creatures, but my character not only loses all objects, but also all memories, and will not make advanced objects. I had to re-teach him all kinds of skills, which reminded me of Tetris, which had to endure a long start in order to experience the final frantic extreme escape.The beginning of Famine needs to be improved. You can add more random events, or multiplayer games, or different character skills. It's important to make death in Famine a loss of game progress, not a half-hour accumulation of boredom. Klei has promised to release large-scale updates within six months, and I am looking forward to their new content and hope that they can correct their existing problems.",True

76561198154425534,"Don't Starve Together is one of those games where you can have fun no matter how many people because it itself, was originally a singleplayer experience. I have barely scratched the surface of the game, so take my review more as a ramble than an proper review, and while I could write most of this on the standard Don't Starve page, I've had more time on this game than standard DS.  First off, the art design. A lot of people say that the game's artstyle is very Tim Burton-esque, and I can wholeheartedly agree on that, but the inclusion of the Telltale heart item and many other things has also lead me to believe that this game and it's art direction was also inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, as the Tell Tale Heart was a story written by him, and Wilsons examination line ""The beating of this hideous heart will bring a ghost back to life!"" is a direct refrence to the story as well, giving me more proof that Poe's works of literature was a good inspiration to the game. I am a fan of the art style, it looks great, and that's all I really need to say.  Next up, the gameplay. which I am splitting up into two parts; the controls, and the general gameplay( characters and such). The controls feel nice, I prefer using keyboard and mouse instead of solely the keyboard or mouse, as both individually have their downsides. For the keyboard, using WASD is better than clicking, you can stop moving right when you need to, but the downside to the keyboard is when you try and do an action such as attacking or using the crafting menu, it's harder to control in my opinion, while the mouse handles both actions better. Despite all of that, I stil enjoy how it controls. But things such as attacking from a distance or force attacking can be a bit off at times. When I found a Varg at the end of a path, I tried to use a sleep dart on it, but instead of instantly shooting the dart, my character kept moving, to the point where I got the Varg aggroed onto me. There have also been countless times where I try to kill a Pigman or Batilisk near a sinkhole, but I keep breaking the walls around it down because force attack. But both of those are minor nitpicks and it doesn't matter in the long run, but to be honest hounds are just awful.  The characters are pretty well balanced, they each have their advantages and disadvantages, except for Wilson and Winona whom I both despise with no end. The two characters I mainly play as, Wendy and Maxwell, have good advantages, such as having Abigail or Shadow Puppets, but those advantages also have disadvantages, such as less damage dealt or being one of the most fragile characters in the game, which is why I hate characters such as Wilson or Winona, they have no real weaknesses, which makes them an easy pick for newers or less experienced players. Playing together is tons of fun if you and your teammates actually know what they're doing. I sometimes play with people I talk to regularly ([u] it would be really nice if my friends would actually respond to me on Discord but whatever.[/u]), or I just log onto public servers and try to survive without voice, but all-in-all, multiplayer is really fun.  [spoiler] But sometimes my connection to Klei's servers are so bad I get kicked from my own world [/spoiler]  And the last topic is price. This game is $14.99, which is also the price of standard Don't Starve, but one of the best part about the price is that you also get a free second copy of the game that you can send to friend, making this game a relative bargain for anyone who's on the fence about the game. It's even better, in my opinion, if you buy the Mega Pack, which saves you about the price of another copy of DST for everything related to Don't Starve except the soundtrack, which by the way, is pretty good. I've had a great time with the game so far, and it's been the only game I've played in the past few weeks, and I don't think that's going to change.  For a rating, I'll give it a 8.5/10, but if you want play Don't Starve Together without anyone, you could play DST by yourself, or you could just get the normal game, which costs more with RoG, but hey, you can also get Shipwrecked, and Hamlet is coming soon.

76561198072130676,"Don't Starve or Die Tryin’  Klei presents multiplayer spinoff of their “Don't Starve” franchise with everything you could expect: stylish artwork, abundance of weird fauna, frantic gameplay. If you are up to surviving simulators and have a few friends to join you on this quest - don’t bother reading further, just get Don't Starve Together instantly.   Most of issues I have with the game are rather personal and won’t be relevant if I could “git gud”. DST is really fast paced and keeps you from doing anything other than playing during whole session. So basically, I had to start with empty bladder and all the snacks and drinks beside me. Feels more like “Stay hydrated while playing”. This kind of approach is totally not my cup of tea. Also, game has some harsh start for beginners, because there is no any in-game tutorial, manual or anything to teach you basics - all is your tries-n-errors.   Art direction is what distinguishes DST from other survival sandboxes. Colorful and diverse world, with no “default” creatures or characters. Play more and you will see more “burtonesque” creations of game designers. Rich playable character roster gives you distinct experience in every playthrough, with char’s unique pros and cons.   What gives game a huge bonus - active modding community. Thanks to the workshop, you can customize your game in almost any way, or even make you game easier and friendlier to beginners: add minimap, display recipes and effects items have, or even “character pause” to have some break. Mechanically everything is quite simple and convenient to get right into playing: controls are intuitive, creating server is not harder than installing game in Steam, same goes with installing mods.   I totally recommend DST: it’s basically endless game with tons of possibilities, actively supported by developers and community.

76561198006838480,"Very enjoyable experience overall, one of the few games that I would show to people and not feel bad for doing so.  Art style heavily influenced from Burtonland. Developers actually care about their community and talk with them as well as actively fix bugs from their bug reporter. Monster AI is predictable and combat is pretty one dimensional, like Dark Souls but with less choices on weapon behaviours.  Game won't hold your hand when playing, so discovery is half the battle. That being said for someone who knows what they're doing the game currently has little to offer, and it is easy to be ""unkillable"" in less than 20 in-game days- the state where the player is prepared for anything that is thrown at them.  Through the Ages content should give more ""end-game"" activities, but it is not here yet as of this review.  The game can be compared to building a card house or sand castle. It is easy to do once you've mastered the skills, but it is just as easy to make a mistake and watch it all crumble.  Update: Because Steam Awards demand it.

Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!  Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge!   Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!

Unless you run a private server, there is the things that turn out to be annoying:  1) scarse resources: unless youre one of the first players on a given world, is really hard to find even a piece of flint.  2) Harsh start without warning: add this to the mix, you can start in the middle of the winter! lol. 3) Bully heaven: as now, nothing stops you for being an A** and burn all the flamable resourses. Almost 99% of the time i join to a new server, more than half the world is already burnt.  in general, a little status about the world before joining in would be nice... as for the pyromaniacs, not sure what can be done, but sure are annoying.

76561198044189299,"The base game is solid, no bugs or problems when me and my boyfriend played, however so far the game is simply different versions of survival mode.   Adventure mode doesn't exist in the game and thus there is no challenge other than surviving as long as you can which, while fun for a few runs, is entirely boring once you hit the plateau of having everything and surviving is no longer a challenge. This is a game with no real end goal or reward, currently.    Original Don't Starve along with the expansions is worth your money more (at this point) if you want a truly fun Don't Starve experience reason to move forward and greater challenges.  You may be able to play with a friend, (which is excellently done I can't stress enough) but with nothing to do but live on forever what's the point in continuous play? However, this is still early access, and hopefully their expansion (to come Spring 2015) will give more reason to play together, as well as encompassing all their other expansions into it as well.   Other than that, hosting and joining servers is flawless. The worlds are exactly the same as Original Don't Starve, with some things from other expansions and new never before seen events and creatures too. It's solid as a whole, but if you're looking for something to play more than once, wait a little longer until they add more to it.

76561198422762478,"I have quite a few hours on Dst and I have to say, they were mostly well spent. Don't starve together has some features that the original game doesn't but I heard that the developers are working on changing that. Dst is a fun game to play if you want to build up a base with friends or with some people who decides to join your world, if you make it public. I've had plenty of games where I helped fight deerclops with some strangers or had to revive my whole team after a failed boss battle or a hound wave. The game has it's ups and downs but there's more ups than downs. Sure, sometimes there is a grief or your base bursting into flames during summer, but that's all part of the experience.   I can rant on and on about how great the game is but there is a big downside to it if you're not used to games like it. You put in a lot of time and effort into your worlds. To running around grabbing grass and twigs, to building up your base and making farms, to surviving hound attacks, and to dealing with seasonal bosses that can destroy an unprepared person with ease. The game runs on a high risk, high reward style and boy, there's a lot of risks. If you're not the type of person who likes to put in a lot of effort and time into a game or you get bored easily, then this game isn't for you.  Sometimes a single mistake by a teammate or yourself can take away all of that progress you made.  Please, look at the game before you spend money on it. Don't get it if your friend is playing it and you just want to fit in. Buy it if you're going to play it with your friends, by yourself, and with random people in servers. I have a friend who bought it just because I play it and only put in a few hours into it before getting bored of it. Don't be a Chris. (Sorry Chris if you somehow read this. You're just an example of what to do if you get bored of heckin everything.  Ya butt)  So, I recommend the game for anyone who's willing to put in time into it.",True
76561198054745951,"I've loved the art for this title since the base games inception and I promise that this version, while missing a few story features, still carries all of the love and charm.   In my opinion, ever since I played Don't Starve in alpha state on Google Chrome, I felt like it would be a fantastic co-op or even versus experience and the steam numbers don't lie, everyone loves Don't Starve Together!  Every character is unique and those specialties are even more colorful in multiplayer as you can take on different roles that you are suited for in your co-op or group play.   If you enjoyed Minecrafts vanilla survival experience but now want a much deeper and more challenging adventure, take the leap and jump into the world of DST!  Note: from here on out (since launch) the base game and Don't Starve Together will have diverging content updates which means that there will be content not included from the base game and vice versa.  Note: in the description it is called ""expansion"" but it is entirely a seperate game, you don't need the original game to play this.   Note: for multiplayer it says (Co-Op) but you can't share screens and you need 2 versions of the game.  Note: game uses Steam Workshop, so you can download tons of mods and that includes some modded in characters from the original game's new expansion ""ShipWrecked"".  Note: difficulty is VERY high, but that is the ""point"" of the game of which is literally called ""Don't Starve""...they mean it.  Despite its challenge, I recommend this game for all ages and interests.  It's not unlikely to die your very first night playing the game, and then the second night, and then the third...but that is the point of the game and once you start diving into this dark and twisted world,  I promise you will find adventure as well as a new tickling, creeping sensation to jump once again through the portal into the Codex Umbra...FOR SCIENCE!",True

When I first started playing, I could barely survive on my own. I was in constant fear of starving to death, going insane, and running for my life from bloodthirsty packs of hounds. I was dying a lot and most of the time it was my own fault. I kept playing though because with each death I learned a little more about how to better survive the next world.  The best part of this game has to be the friendly community. I always love joining a random server and being greeted with a friendly ""hello"" usually followed by directions to a base. I learned most of my Don't Starve skills from more experienced players who offered their help and advice. Now I happily do the same thing for new players. It's a great feeling knowing that people are enjoying the game more because of me.  If you ever get bored of the normal gameplay there are also tons of great mods on the steam workshop.

There are few surprises or new thought put into the game or its newly found multiplayer perspective. It works well. I am having fun just as I did when I first started playing two or so years ago. My only beef is that the dev apparently got greedy and charged for 'early-access' to multiplayer. I put early-access in quotes because it will eventually be free to anyone who owns the single player build, but not till sometime in the future (who really knows, right?).  I have to overall recommend this version, because it is really fun. Setting up a personal server is simple and you can get playing right away.",True

76561198066905165,"I must be one of the only few people who is not enthusiastic about Don't Starve. I definitely recognise it has a lot of qualities. Nice hand-drawn graphics, a real universe of its own with funny characters and monsters and a lot of imagination. The concept itself is original: a mixture of craft and survival with a strong emphasis on the survival part, rather than on the building part. And you can play it multiplayer, that's great !  So why the thumb down ? Well in this kind of game, the aspect I usually like is the building part. You farm, you collect, you build, and you let your own imagination decide how your camp is going to look like, what gears you're gonna craft to go hunting, etc. However, the very core of the game is the constant pressure that you have little time to gather food, handle your health, mental health and hunger at the same time, and still build the things that are necessary to survive the winter and the monsters. Consequently, the creative part is totally overshadowed by the need to survive (at least for low-level players like me).   Furthermore,  the game, from its title to the essence of its gameplay, cynically pushes you to see how long you can survive, because you'll eventually die, it is just a matter of when and how. And surviving is merely rewarded by your score, i.e., the number of days you spend before dying. The worst part for me is the absence of Steam achievement to motivate me to try and try again. I die ? Well I can launch a new game, but maybe just to die a little later, which means at best discovering a few more mobs or objects and... that's it. Well, sorry guys but that can't keep me motivated.  Not a bad game by any mean, but not oriented towards creativity, and not rewarding enough for me.",False

76561198052586802,"My review about this game was originally a silly joke in the form of a satirical in-game scenario, but I feel like I really need to do it some justice. Don't Starve Together, ideally, is just that: Don't Starve, but Together, with other people, normally with your friends since public servers are admittedly going to generally be pretty toxic. However, it is still perfectly playable solo, and there's so much more to the game than just being a multiplayer version of its predecessor. The team behind it seems genuinely passionate about what they're doing, so much so that some of it even rubs off on the workshop and the creators of a lot of the mods in it. They even gave Don't Starve Together away to owners of Don't Starve for FREE back when it was still in the beginning of its early access stage, and INCLUDED all the DLC they had for the latter game at the time.  To start, if you don't know what Don't Starve (Together) is, it's probably one of the oldest, truest, and all-around best survival sandbox games out there. It has a unique artstyle, some interesting lore, and easy-to-learn but still always threatening and challenging gameplay. After hundreds of hours, I'm still learning and being amazed, or, at the very least, intrigued by a lot of the things I still don't know about that I accidentally stumble upon while playing. It's truly a new experience every time. It also doesn't have the problem almost every ""survival game"" out there has nowadays, too, with being very one-dimensional, predictable, or feeling just like one of those dime-a-dozen copies of popular representatives of the genre. There's so much you can customize for each individual world, both the good and the bad, the objects and the mechanics, it's just overall very customizeable, which is always a welcome feature, especially to the picky folk or perhaps the type who easily get bored of games with one or very few different settings, and that's not even mentioning the mods.  Oh gosh yes, the workshop. It's absolutely wonderful. Although a lot of people can agree that making and maintaining mods for the game can be very difficult and ""time consuming and a mess of coding"" in the game's current stage, the level of activity and additional customization that can be found in the workshop is amazing and provides virtually unlimited replayability to the game.  Honestly, to any modders reading this who still support their mods, I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm genuinely thankful for what you're doing. You make the community and the game even more awesome than it already is, and it wouldn't quite be what it is without all of your contributions. Unless all you do is make reskinned Wilsons of anime, pony, or FNaF characters with nothing more than a buff to the base character stats. Seriously, cut that out. It's embarrassing for everyone.  This is also the only game I know of with an in-game market worthy of mentioning without some stupid desperate attempt to grab your cash for every box you want to open. You get free boxes of cosmetic items for your characters just by playing, and can also open them... for free! And you can even buy and sell them on the Steam market, and recycle them with a function in game.  Seriously, I can't think of any downsides with this game--even if I could, the good most certainly outweighs the bad--and it's tough to imagine Klei bailing out on development and letting us down. So why haven't you gotten this game yet? The devs deserve your support and you deserve to give yourself a quality time killer!",True

I'll keep it kind of short for this one, as I'm sure I'll have to update it many times in the future as Klei decides to host more events and push out more content for this game.   As you can see, I've spent a lot of time in this game, and truly it feels like barely any time at all. Time passes at supersonic speed when playing this game with a good group of buddies, and it's honestly impossible to not make friends while playing this. Every single friend on my steam list is someone I either met from this game or someone I made buy the game and play it with me.   This game is grindy and never ending, there are seasonal events every year with new content to explore and new cosmetic drops to collect. There are also random events that change the game entirely, one being a crazy ranked nonstop battling competition that even had people screaming about nerfs and metas and yelling at each other as if we were playing League. The other random event that recently took place was similar to an Overcooked style of gameplay and was very hectic and fun. There is also random puzzles that are released and involve team work to unlock special skin prizes.   I've been pretty active in the forums for this game and have watched many, many streams or YT videos of it, as well as playing in every event. So I definitely have a good grasp on this one.   This is a surivial game that allows you to spend all your time exploring, farming, battling bosses or dungeon crawling the caves. There is a lot going on in this one, and I have tried to find many games ""similar to Don't Starve Together"" and none compare. There is just something about how this game will literally allow you to do anything or play to any style and look so nice artwork wise as well, that just can't be compared in other surivial games.   TONS of lore that is constantly being expanded on and explained, a huge world with options to increase or decrease any aspect of it, including difficulty. Can play with any number of friends, and while people tend to talk about a difficulty curve in this game, I really do not think this is that hard and anyone can learn to play it and ""not starve"". Though dying to random BS is probably more likely than starving....   The workshop makes this game never boring as it allows creativity to flow to the max. I've played TF2 battle royale type games with some friends, and been in servers that were practically VRChat level of roleplaying and BS. You can make this more like Animal Crossing if you want, or more like a horror game, or more like a PVP game. Literally anything you want this game to be or any character you want in it, the workshop will have it. This game can't be recommended enough and can fit anybody expectations.

You make an axe and start to collect wood logs. OH NO IT'S NIGHT TIME WE GON DIEEEEE. You now have to make a fire. All of these simple beginners steps turn your caveperson like sprite, into a brave warrior who fights wolves from hell, living trees, and a huge deer with one eye whos one wish in life is to crush you and your friends hard work (and or skulls).

So this review just turned into a grammar lesson about the plural form of nouns that end with ""y"".  [b] Ahem... [/b]  How do you form the plural of a proper noun that ends in y such as Murphy? Should you change the name to Murphies? Given how other English words ending in y form their plurals, you would think so.

Instead, just add s. Examples: I visited the Murphys last weekend. We have two Zacharys in our office.  What if you want to show possession with a name that ends in y? Rule: To show singular possession, use the apostrophe and then the s. Example: I petted Mrs. Murphy’s cat.  Rule: To show plural possession, make the proper noun plural first, then use the apostrophe. Examples: I petted the Murphys’ cat. I visited the Murphys’ store on Main Street.

Some key points that this game add on has to offer:  1.	Fully standalone multiplayer game. 2.	Co-op survival or PVP. 3.	Create your own local, private or open server for up to 6 players. 4.	The Gorge Event to offer a reason to always want to come back. 5.	Everything we have in Don’t Starve we almost have here but now we get to enjoy it with friends.  Replayability:  It goes without saying that this game requires replays so we won’t go into it here, it is a requirement by now, Don’t starve until you do, then you die and get XP based on how long you survived, XP unlocks new characters for you to try out.   MGRza’s Conclusions:  This game isn’t just another expansion but gives us a brand new game in multiplayer so that we can play with friends or new comers in the same world we have come to know, Don’t Starve together also includes Reign of Giants; adding new characters, seasons, creatures, biomes, and giant new challenges for you to undertake either solo or with a couple of friends. You can start the game by either selecting a random server from the available list, or joining a server created by mates or go at it by yourself by creating and customizing your own server, setting it up the way you want it, adding extras to it, mods or other add ons from the community and then when you are set you can make it public or private and once you are ready you can start your new journey and see how far you get.

You have to worry about freezing to death in the winter, constant rain in the spring will drive you insane, and the summer gets so hot it will set your things on fire. Finding specific resources as a group and crafting items can help alliviate these problems, but disasters will happen regardless.  The combat is very simple, and some might call it lame, but I enjoy it. Often times it is better to run from an enemy than fight it.

Trap those trunk animal thingies that I can never spell correctly, TOGETHER. Almost freeze to death TOGETHER. Ditch your friends and hide in a cave whilst they get murdered by hounds and a deerclops on the same night... (Maybe not together) Also fun to rebuild the base TOGETHER.

Together... And ending our adventure to a frog rain and hound attack at the same time... Together.

Let's start off with the good.  This game is so much fun with friends and a GREAT way to make friends. On average (from my experience) the communty i friendly. It is Don't Starve, after all, so it's a unique gameplay and idea. There's a bunch to do, especially with mods. I've done everything form 1v1 tournaments to just regularly playing/surviving. The game is updated regularly and maintained with a close eye. I love how responsive the creators at Klei are. They love to stay interactive with their fans and fellow gamers. There's an interesting backstory to DST, which branches from DS (Learn about it by playing the CycIum puzzle). I just love this game so much.  Now, for the bad.  There's not much here. There are and always will be bugs, especially when mods are involved. Without Don't Starve background, the game can be a bit dificult, but that shouldn't be a problem with help from the other gamers (assuming your server has other people). That's pretty much it. The game isn't really bad.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who:  A) Likes survival games.  B) Likes games that involve interracting / making friends.  C) Likes a very interesting sketch-like art style.",True

If you've played Don't Starve, don't worry, this game is almost identical to Don't Starve, aside from the multiplayer capabilities and a few relatively minor features. Gameplay-wise, Don't Starve translates very well to multiplayer. It's easier to gather food and other resources with 2+ people, but more resources are needed to support the extra people. It manages to balance the game experience very well, without feeling like having extra people is a negative.  Don't Starve Together strikes a great balance between difficulty and accessibility. It is challenging but never gets frustrating or annoying. The rush during the ""easy"" seasons to prepare for winter makes for an enjoyable gameplay loop that is seemingly repetitive, but doesn't get boring thanks to the wide array of possibilities when playing.  The modding community is another strong point of DST. There is a huge variety of characters to play as if you get bored of the base game. There are also quite a few content mods, adding new things to craft, new enemies, new biomes, etc.   Overall, DST is a fantastic game to play with friends and one with a lot of replayability.",True

We still haven't explored everything, which means that we'll probably still be playing a lot more.

76561198092751351,"Don't Starve Together is not just uncompromising but can also be unforgiving. Do not be misled by it's squiggly graphics as the real meat of the game is elsewhere. It has defined its own niche in the survival genre and has inspired a lot of new games in the process. Given the enormous amount of details that you need to be wary of in order to survive, this could easily be one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play and yet you may not hate it.  This game demands a lot of patience from its players and expects them to learn from their mistakes quickly. This game rewards forethought but unforgivingly punishes carelessness. The quality of your choices will greatly affect your survival process. The players will not just combat callous monsters, eerie darkness, and constant hunger, but also their own stupidity. This game will teach you to turn every lurking danger into opportunity rather than simply generalizing every outcome as either good or bad.  Pros: 1)The Game is rich with endless content that'll keep you curious and entertained. 2)Involves a lot of scouting, gathering of resources and their management, item-crafting, and base-building. You'll also have to deal with hostile monsters and an uncaring climate. 3)Good Teamplay will be a satisfying experience. Conversely, bad  team players will make their uninviting presence felt.  Cons: 1) You may die a lot initially before you get a hang of the game dynamics.  ",True

76561198079563788,The games gameplay is very celever and startegic. It makes you think about how much time you have left and what goal can be done in that time. The machines and the stuff that are in the game are very well implemented. I didnt play the game for much because i dont like the kind of games that reset everytime and i am not very good at the game nor did i try to be so i restarted a lot. Its the same as the original game but now you can play it with friends and other people. overall its a great game. 9/10,True
76561198144736008,"First off,  this game is undeniably good, for his great community, mod support, and hard gameplay. For a dont starve diehard like me it's pretty easy to like this game, since i pratically loved the ""Dont starve single player""  But ill try to get in the shoes of someone that's new to the genre and the game.  -Is it good for a starter? Has it got some replayability?  This game is actually pretty hard at the start, and you need to get the hand of it, so dont ragequit if you die once. But the gameplay is solid and not repetitive, every world is different from eachother, and you can survive pretty much untill you get bored and you want to restart,and belive me, you will not get bored untill the 1000th day. But i reccomand playing a bit alone to get the hang of it hosting your private server.  -Do the servers cost?   ABSOLUTELLY NOT! You can play with your friends wherever you want and whenever you want. It's pretty much like Terraria and Starbound (NOT COMPARATING THESE GAMES WITH DONT STARVE TOGETHER, JUST COMPARING THE SERVER SYSTEM) where you can host your private server and let people join in, but if the hoster crashes/leaves the server, it will be closed. But if you want to evitate that and you have a  big wallet, you can buy a dedicated server and do whatever you want with it, since it's open 24/7  -Is it good to coop with other players? what differenciate this game from the single player standalone edition?  Well, if you want to play a hard survival game with your buddies, this is the game for you,and actually, having coop in dont starve it's not that bad,you can do crazy things with some character combos. This game is pretty good for your pockets and time as well! Since all characters and content for Reign of Giants (Dont starve DLC) is in there and all characters are unlocked, so you dont need to do those crazy things to unlock characters again (im talking to you webber). The game has a lot of new content released in the ""A new reign"" expansion, such as new bosses,new items, and overall a lot of fitting addictions in the game, that the standalone version doesnt benefit of. Another great featuers of Dont Starve Together are the gamemodes, instead of survival (basically you die and lose everything, such as the original ""Dont Starve"")  you can choose a different mode, such as Endless, (you become a ghost when you die and you can revive your buddies with a special item or you can directly go to the portal where you spawned).  Another thing (that i suppose some people aren't a fan of) are the skins for the characters and items, i dont say that is a good or bad thing, but thats based on your personal tastes, i personally like how the skins change the boring look of the normal character to please the eye a bit, but i dont reccomand spending money on them, or at least not too much, you know, it's not Cs:go where you only show off your knives.  -Are mods a bad thing? Do they ruin the overall experience?  It depends, again, based on your personal tastes. If you are bored of the base game, you can just personalize it adding new bosses/characters/items created by this awesome and active mod community,or if you want to just add some graphical/HUD tweaks, client mods exist for that! and you dont need to apply them in your server, so you spare some HDD space for your buddies. Overall, mods are an optional thing, im just here to say that they exist  -I hear a lot about seasonal events, what are they? Are they invasive in some way?  Events are a new thing introduced in Dont Starve Together to keep the game alive (as i think their purpose is). They mostly introduce new items and skins for a limited time (Such as the Chrismas tree and the ""Snowfallen"" skin set for characters) or introduce a new mode for a bit, that gives skins as a reward (Ex: The Forge, an arena survival based coop mode with classes) If you dont like partecipating these events (you are an horrible pearson), you can still enjoy the base game without any problems :D  -I got this game free, why?  Klei gave the game for free to the owners of ""Dont Starve"" before the DST's complete game launch   I am pretty surprised that Klei made such an awesome improvement from the basic Dont starve! Not just like a quick cash grab adding a multyplayer separated feature.  Again, I higly suggest to play this game with your friends, the more you are, the more fun it gets ;D  9/10 (because no game is perfect :P)",True

New players:  You will die repeatedly at first.  It's part of the fun.  Challenge yourself to get further each time and learn at your own pace.  If you need help, you can ask for it but I suggest doing your own thing for awhile until you figure out the basics.  Everyone has their own way of doing things - find yours.

Today i have played 900 hours of Don't starve together and i can't say i wasted a second on this game. Truth be told, i wanted a refund at the start when i first got it. DST was in beta, and i felt tricked when i had ROG in don't starve and ROG in DST. but it all changed with the DLC that was free for all of us and consistently rewards us with items and new features to make us smile.

Oh hey so, you watched the trailer and some gameplay, checked the pictures, everything in this game seems nice and fun, gonna be a relaxing experience after work huh?   HELL NO.  Firstly, the game is gonna punish you in one way or another. You decided that today you will find lots of food?  Hey, you forgot to get wood for the campfire >Dead.  You decide to spend the day mining and getting some wood for the campfire, hey you forgot the food >Starve to death.  Your actions must be really balanced if you want to survive. This isn't the type of game where you can have the same routine however like in Minecraft,nor it gets ridiculously hard as you make progress. It's just that small change that can lead to your death if you're not careful.  The game is just huge. I've got atleast 30 hours in it(combined with DS) and I still haven't explored 10% of it. Amazing ammount of detail to everything, seasons with huge changes to creatures/environment, countless creatures, neutral or hostile.   •Should I get this game?: Of course yes.  •Is it gonna be hard for me?: Oh hell yeah, you better prepare yourself for surviving 20 days after multiple hounds attacks, huge tree monsters and having a huge stock of berries to make it through winter just to get killed by a damn frog.  •Something in this game that isn't trying to kill me?:  Not even the rabbits.. the god damn rabbits.       ~10/10",True

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I figured I thus might as well tack on a few extras, both to give some info for newer players, and for the Steam badge obviously.   The game itself has quite a well learning curve. At first, you're going to die, you're going to make unfamiliar and useless things. We all start somewhere. Eventually, however, you're going to find a strategy, whether it be ruthless slaughter, or base-sitting farming. Of course, the game doesn't give a break, and constant threats coming from all angles, keeping you on your toes. Both it and its predecessor, Don't Starve, share similarities and differences that make each game the same, yet an entirely different, experience. The game itself is superbly fun, but the only downside I see is that even with the new content additions, server optimization is below average, and even playing with 1 other friend living a state away from me with caves enabled caused the server to chug, and overall be unstable at most times.

Recently however i've been permanently banned from the DST community hub just for voicing my opinion about this toxic community.  Let me state this clearly though, as some people have not gotten the memo yet.  [b]IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING THIS WITH [i]FRIENDS[/i] AND ONLY [i]FRIENDS[/i], DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS REVIEW. PLEASE BUY THE GAME, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER[/b]  [h1]#1: Furries[/h1]    These ""people"" upload as much furry content to the workshop as they can. At least 50% of custom characters uploaded the Steam Workshop are these ""fursonas"" or whatnot. These bipolar toddlers are god-damned disturbing as well. I recall once joining a server with said characters and seeing something along ""ohmygodddd it looks so hot XD"" in the chat, no I am not exaggerating. Say anything that these neglected kids have a differentiating opinion on and they'll introduce you to their fast typing skills of ""stfu"" or the classic ""YOU JUST CAN'T APPRECIATE THE FURRY COMMUNITY FAG"". Furthermore, I posted this picture to the community hub:  http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/366zzf (Furries everywhere)     Within half a week I was permanently banned from posting anything to the DST hub. And when I investigated by looking in the page source (They mods never specified why I was banned in the first place, funny) I found that I was banned for ""Offensive content and Spamming"". Neither of which is valid in any way at all. Most of the Furrys had the nerve to go on my profile and report a bunch of my other content. They managed to team up to take down all my Payday 2 posts, one of which had around 1,200 likes and was on the top Steam posts for about a week. To this day, a -year and a half- two years later my privileges are revoked on both hubs. Thanks, assholes.  [h1]#2: Kids[/h1]    I'm fine with kids playing games, i'm going to clear that up right now. But when you have 7-9 year olds playing online, always asking you for ""flint pls"" or spamming ""xD"" in the chat it admittedly gets annoying after awhile. (Thanks the Klei for not adding voice chat I haven't gone completeky insane from these kids.) This is fine however as they usually keep to themselves or just tag along with a friend, but usually this is not the case. Don't expect to come across any kids with respect for you or anyone. They also like to follow you around and steal your loot, that's cool too.  [h1]#3: Griefers[/h1]    Remember that game Minecraft? Well, in that game the multiplayer servers had 'Griefers'. These people would go around and purposely destroy other peoples creations. But in this, these people will play as the character Willow who starts off with a lighter, they will then go around and set everything on fire making most servers unplayable knowing that all the resources have been destroyed. Unless the existing players have some sort of plant and tree seeds stored away, the server becomes unplayable as it has no wood or food. This happens to most servers without some sort of anti-grief feature. Luckily, more servers are adopting new anti grief mods. So this isn't too much to worry about.  [h1]#4: Stupid people in general[/h1]    I'm not saying everyone is, but a good majority of people in the community are. From ingame people asking all the time ""how 2 I get wood?/"", and the community putting useless guides and discussions in the community, it's damn annoying.  To start off, ingame you're most likely to come acroos flat out stupid players. For example, this one time I found a pig village (An uncommon group of buildings that are accompanied by lots of food) I ran about 5 minutes to get to it, and I found a lot of berries enough to last me a few days. I then grab the berries and start walking away. Sooner or later come across the owner of the server and he said to me, (and trust me these were just about his exact words) ""wow you just took my berries"" Banned from the server, why? Because I took ""his"" berries. This was on an open public server. This is an uncommon example, but i feel like this game appeals to ""that"" demographic of kids, y'know? Like the Roblox/Minecraft/Unturned kids. Extrememly toxic and malicious kids.   And the Steam community is much worse. If you go on the DST Community Hub right now, you'll see many Guides and Discussions made by little kids who don't know what the term ""proper english"" means. To be completely honest I could write a book longer than the entite Hunger Games book trilogy complaining about how damned this community is. Take a look for yourself, you'll see what I mean.     There's my rant about why this community is horrible. If you're a decent human being who; doesn't jerk off to animals, you're over 12, nice to people, and has actually had an education. You should pat yourself on the back, god thanks you. But still avoid this game. (I'm guessing everyone's going to flag this for ""offesive content and spam"", right?)

All the while she says nothing It's Summer now and this wendy is still here. Down to 3 ghosts, everyone else ragequit. Wendy finally speaks.

Take your time to enjoy the (slightly hidden) story and learn the most efficient strategies, combining crafting and interacting with the world. The combination of 2D cartoon-style graphics with a 3D world was a clever idea and makes the game quite light-weight. The Together version is, to my mind, the most enjoyable when playing cooperative. Still, I suggest playing alone, or trying the single player Don't Starve first, for the max experience.  I also have to mention the mysterious analytics system of Klei. The game collects information about you, but it doesn't explain what exactly it is. There is an option to disable the Analytics but if you do, you can't play online (""Together"" is the online version, it has no other purpose).

Once you realize you can make it to day 50 without much of effort you realize that going around a map and trying to loot different stuff is... yea, pretty useless since you have only one goal.

Recommend it for people who wants to have good time with friends and relax and chill.,True
76561198081023231,"Don't Starve Together is a wonderfully unique multiplayer survival game. The survival mechanics are simple but fun. I can sit down for a while just picking things up on the ground, cutting trees, and exploring the map that's different every world you make, the weather and season even changes. Playing the game with friends is fun and adds more to the survival management of living in the odd world. However new players may be fairly confused with how some of the items crafted or found in the wilf are for and do. Not even I know what some things do exactly, so I suggest pulling up the Don't Starve Wiki to learn what some things do. I think more in-game explanation would've been very nice.  A lot of the giants, the bosses that wonder about or spawn at specific condition, as well as just some of the normal hostile mobs wondering out and about are frustratingly awful to fight, their attacks can stunlock you into taking damage in a huge chain and it's almost impossible to attack without taking damage yourself. One of the first giants you fight during the winter season is Deerclops,  a beefy big creature that spawns sometime in the winter to walk over to you to fight, you'd better not be at your base as it will wreak everything up. The problem with Deerclops is that his main attack is this punch that sends a punch of ice spikes at you, there is no way of attacking him without being hit because there is no way of sprinting away fast enough before your littered with ice. More forgiving combat would be nice.  For people wanting to get into this for a single type thing is not going to have very much luck, the mobs have been rebalanced for more than just one person, giving them more health and damage, making it almost unplayable. However using the Steam Workshop you can download many mods from many different people to make the game a bit easy on you. You can get mods that change the mob health depending on the amount of players in your server and a mod that allows you to pause your game. However I'd just suggest the single player Don't starve as it's more refined for that play style of playing all on your own.  Every week you can get some gift boxes and this resets every Thursday. These gifts contain cosmetic items that you can put on your character, they can even be sold on the community market as well as be traded so if your're into all that it's pretty nice. Speaking of characters, you can pick from many differnt characters with different traits, stats, and unique abilities. It's great to play with all the characters to see how they all work and play.  Overall the game is quite nice, I like the survival stuff in the game, the unique world you discover, the style of how the world is depicted. Despite the somewhat bad combat, lack of explanation of things, the game is really good and I'd suggest anyone who enjoys survival games to try it out. How ever people who want to play single player wither play the normal Don't Starve or go into the Steam Workshop to download some mods to make it a bit easy.",True

Don't be a newbie, don't play this character it is trash, don't touch anything, don't move anything. I understand that when you put a lot of effort into something, you don't want it to be ruined.

Figured I should throw it a thumbs up.  The aspects of the game that I feel are worth mentioning: -If you do not have very good internet, the game's difficulty spikes because combat relies heavy on a strong connection. Otherwise, you are forced to deal with lag or just play alone on your own server. -Being good at this game is mostly based on knowledge. If you know how to survive and what does what, survival is rather easy. But there is a lot to see. wear armor lul -Events that are only for limited amounts of time that are inaccessible and apparently do not really profit the creators due to the cost of hosted servers so further reappearances of the Forge and Gorge aren't confirmed even if they are a ton of fun but I think there's a Forge mod -Barebones plot -Just getting through 1 season (which are 15 or 20 days on default settings aka the only true way to play) takes hours  I prefer Together to the singleplayer version because I wasn't a fan of worldhopping which felt like starting a new game but just giving yourself endgame stuff at the beginning of it. Together just has worlds that are meant to last for eternity, everything is renewable that might not be in singleplayer. But singleplayer does have Shipwrecked and Hamlet.

The way Klei Entertainemnt has implemented Don't Starve into a multiplayer scheme is creative. The gameplay is the same as it is in Don't Starve only adding mechanics of revival. The only problem I have with the game is that only 6 people max can join most games reaching 12 to where I've seen. They should increase the max player count just a bit. That would change it from a 9/10 to a 10/10. But then again I'm not of big importance on the gaming scene.",True

The game has an incredible amount of depth, the visual design is great and the music fits perfectly, this is, however, one of those games you must read a few guides if you want to make it far.  This is also a game you shouls buy only if you have some other friends to play with, because playing on your own is not as fun, as the enemy mobs and events are meant to be tackled with at least two players.

76561198085969853,"While reading through the reviews just for fun, I've realised that the vast majority of the negative ones are from people who said that the game was bad because they couldn't survive (which is stupid). Since they all had minimal hours in the game, they must be noobs. Everybody starts off starving to death, getting killed by things etc. If you just take the time to learn how to survive it will be a far better experience. You will not only survive, but thrive. For instance, I was terrible at the game to start so I died a lot. Now I can solo kill Dragonfly and the other giants without much issue, clear the ruins with ease, and I often have too much food. This is a fantastic game to play with friends, and very fun alone as well. (Although if you play with too many inexperienced people than it may be quite hard to keep everybody fed)  9.5/10",True

76561198134693828,"[h1]A survival game with a dark mood to it[/h1]  This game will test your ability to adapt to the current situation better then most survival games ever made. With simple controls and a simple concept (don't starve), you will be constantly thrown into harsh unpredictable situations in which every decision will directly impact whether you survive or die the another day. A great game to play with friends cooperatively which will test your chemistry to the limits.   I absolutely adore the artstyle & soundtracks. The atmosphere and soundscape never fail to create a warm fuzzy (yet dark and macabre) feeling as you play. This being said, it is an inherently ""grind"" heavy game and most of your time will be spent performing repetitive tasks (or dying). It's also lacks some end-game motivation.  8/10 All in all a great game to play, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a game that doesn't hold your hand and tell you exactly what you need to do.",True

76561198094323685,"With its unique artwork and mechanics this game deserves a good old 10/10.    Whatever you like survival games or not its a 'must play'. It is here for years now and it has become one of the most liked survival games so there re lots of gameplay videos and trailers you can check before buying. But like i mentioned its a must have and its really cheap for its worth.  pros: - endless gameplay with lots of content. - awsome graphics, sounds/musics. - very colorfull and changing with all the biomes, seasons, day-night cycles and even with random maps which has to be like a copy of each other but nope they re not. - even tough its a sandbox survival it has a very good story mod which is implented in sandbox play. i consider it a pro cos first of all you can play both sandbox and story mod in one save with same character without ruining or effecting each other. starting the story mode is even better. you dont just click a button but complete some task which re not given but to be solved as you play. not givin more info as it will be spoiler. - simple to play hard to survive meaning you can play with your family or moto gang. - runs smooth even on low spec laptops with all that shinny graphics thanks to easy to render artwork models. - bug free! yes never noticed any bugs. well maybe there is some but not even noticed so gues its more than enough. - for controller types this is one of the rare games that i consider gamepad is better. good support and even if you re not familiar with a controller you can easily get used to it while playing dont starve in minutes. well its a must if you ask me. - very active developers. every month/year i expect them to leave the game alone as its ok already but now they come up with even more content. - very active workshop. lots of mods new characters etc. - CHEAP for this kind of game and developing/support. really they deserve more for sure. - even if you say im done with this game (well yea after a year or something you dont wanna spend like 5 hours playing same game) you cant get rid of all those artwork, musics and all kind of stuff about this game. it suddenly becomes something like a childhood memory that you cant forget. just like a cartoon character or something.   well cant think of a con but maybe some can say its a bit repeating but to say that you need to spend at least dunno 3-4 months playing. also 1 out of 20 people hates this game just in very first mins of gameplay for no reason. dunno why maybe the artwork but yea thats the fact :D  so if you want to add another game to your favorites of all time list just go for it.

I would have to say that even though I found the game enjoyable and tons of fun, it doesn't have lots of replay value. After you've played multiplayer for a few days, and each server resets itself, it gets kind of repetetive I'd say. You start to see the pattern emerging and quickly get tired of it.

The world really wants to kill you, especially when it sends frog rain + summer heat in the evening during the - you guessed it - Summer.  You're forced to go near the beefalo and hope that they kill the frogs or you will find yourself dead by being ganged on. Oh and be sure you have a beefalo hat since that's when they're in the rut and will attack anything that gets too close.  Even birds.  Then after that, it will send hounds. Oh and I hope you had collected ice or you will die from overheating.  Straw hats only do so much to keep you cool.  But that's not the end of it, nope.  Your farms will become withered no matter what you grow but the good thing is that drying racks dry really easy so you can make two times the jerky that you got from the beefalo and frogs that died before.

76561198011399656,"A challenging yet enjoyable survival wilderness game. Servers are extremely customizable and you can pretty much add as many mods as you want. If you really want to use it, there even is a cheat console in-game. The characters are also diverse in their skill sets, difficulty level, and personalities.   You also receive a free copy of DST when you purchase it, so you can gift it to a friend.  Microtransactions are mainly limited to cosmetics - even then, you can get a lot of them for free in-game (though randomly). The MTs are also unintrustive, they won't nag you to purchase resources/boosters/etc...unlike some other games. Massive updates and new content are also free as well!    ------------ EDIT ------------  However, I do want to point out there are special characters you can buy with real money, but they are also craftable using (an absurd amount of) spools. Some you receive for ""free"" in DST if you buy the associated DLC for Don't Starve (single player). I feel somewhat conflicted about this because I don't want to see Klei adopting some of the nastier aspects of the game industry's business models (looking at you, EA).  - For some players, this is a time or money gate-lock.  - Spools are obtained via unraveling undesired cosmetics. - Spools gained are based on the cosmetic's quality.  - Cosmetics are gained randomly, with no set time rate* - *Cosmetics are given as daily log in rewards. It's a guaranteed reward, but definitely feeds into a sense of addiction (i.e. ""Don't miss the daily log in item!"")  As of this review, DST has a base price of $14.99. It's not a $60 game that microtransactions the living daylights out of its playerbase, but it's always good to be wary of such changes. I do love this game and I will still recommend it, but I'll be keeping an eye out.",True

76561198013645715,"First of all, this game is close to my heart for it's style, all quirky, like a 90s Tim Burton movie, with great characters, different quotes and interactions for each one, so there's a lot of replayability just in that.   As a multiplayer game that keeps the challenging aspects of the original but understood that it would need a lot more, you'll find a lot of stuff to do here, even if you didn't like Don't Starve (alone? lol) at first. You can keep the difficulty and try to go as far as you can with your friends, but you could also mess around with the settings, make it easier to survive and just have fun, there's even a ton of mods made by the community that could change almost any aspect of the game that could make it frustrating for any type of player, so I could recommend this game to anyone.   Now, about the challenge, which is my favorite part of this game...   You have to spend some hours on it, it's totally time based, which means that as the time goes by, you get hungry and have to gather enough resources to eat (well, it's called Don't Starve), make it through the night, survive random events, defeat or get away from strong enemies that show up around you... And then, you find something you've never seen before or falls to an unexpected effect, it kills everyone, and you have to restart the map. Just to be clear, you can use the settings to make the game easier to try again or even never lose your progress, but learning after dying and trying over and over again is the core experience of this game for me, and by the way, starting a new map, wondering what you'll find - since it's a different map every time- and how far you'll make it this time is incredbly fun.   And if you're already convinced to play it and would like a piece of advice from me, don't look up stuff on the internet. As I said, learning through failure is a core aspect of the game, it's still fun -and hard- if you know about everything, but some of my best experiences happened when I was learning from friends and overcoming challenges by discovering something new through trial and error.  As of now, I've never got to see Summer and never beaten more than one boss (which is a very recent victory), and also never got to mess around with magic items, you could think that's a noobish thing, and well, it is, but that's the thing, all the stuff I haven't done yet makes me incredibly excited to find out what's next and keep playing.",True

That being said  Dont Starve Together is a rogue-like survival game that puts you in the wilderness with nothing but your wits and your enthusiasm to not starve, easy right? So what do you do?  You run around picking up rocks, sticks, and other things that may or may not help you into your journey.  You will craft many things from the simple axe to gather wood for the fires to the  complex dark sword that will help you in combat.  You will discover the inhabitants and the creatures that linger around the world of dont starve. Figuring out which one would kill you is also part of the fun and probably 70% of the time that you figure out what DOES kill you is probably the time you are dead.  But that's ok, lessons learned and you set off out just to die again from another silly mistake.  the more you learn, the more it will help you survive longer. From days, you survive weeks. From weeks you survives seasons. From seasons, you survive years.  Oh yeah, its also fun to play online with other people.... Just remember to be nice and you will have a good time.

Honestly, I thought I'd hate this game for sure.  My (now ex lover) lover gifted it to me as a gift so we can play together.  I remember at first saying I don't really like how it looks.  Then 1 hour later I'm yelling at spiders to give me it's silk so we can make tents cause I'm the bread bringer.  2 days and over 16 hours.  Yeah, new addiction.

Art style is something you either love or hate - but I found it really suiting to the atmosphere the game conveys. Lots of stuff to explore, different challenges every season, tons of community mods - highly recommended. My only issue with the game is lack of any form of overarching campaign - unlike the original Don't Starve, but multiplayer makes up for that!",True

76561197986460776,"GAME REVIEW  Don't Starve Together is a game for those who have been looking for something fun to do with their friends; that is not mechanically intensive like a MOBA, or reaction and hardware based lke a shooter but instead a truly cooperative survival game that doesn't base itself on zombies. The game design is incredible every time you load up into a world it feels different yet fimiliar and evokes different challenges and ways to approach survival allowing the game to feel fresh and highly replayable.  The crafting system in this game is by far one of my favorite advancements in the survival genre; you no longer need the craft on a table the recipes are available to you from the start and is conveniently placed on the left hand side for you to explore at any time with out the need of guides and walk throughs. The level design is easily the corner stone of this game making every enemy and NPC feel natural to the world as if they had been there long before you ever loaded up giving you a sense that you don't belong in the game space and are not fit to survive. I honestly felt bad the first time I cold-blood murder my PIg-man neighbor over a berry bush near our house and then ate him cause I was starving. Now everytime I pass by his empty house I remeber what crime I have comitted for the sake of survival. RIP my bacon-y friend.   All of my friends who have played this game have loved it trust me its worth the investment you are going to have blast. ",True

This game is super basic it basically like 2d minecraft that you will learn to cooperate with your friends to just survive and don't starve.

Enemies have attack patterns that you must follow to minimize (or overall nullify) the damage you'll receive (How? Well, dodging, or ''juking''.)  Three base stats. Hunger, Sanity, Health. Keep hunger high by eating food (Not ANY kind of food, mind you. Monster meat won't do you any good unless you play as certain characters.); keep sanity high by staying away from insanity sources (being in the dark, monsters, being soaked in water); keep health high by healing yourself (There's both edibles and other items that can replenish your health).

76561198022534487,"Mr. Gaben, reviewers, friends, and my fellow gamers: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence, and on behalf of my family here and gone, I accept your nomination to write this review for no one else but you. I thank Valve‘s Mike Harrington for that gracious chance. You’re a true friend and a great company leader. But Mike knows the introduction I prefer is a little shorter. I’m a gamer, a player and even a gamer, in that order.  I’m new to this review duty, and honestly I never thought I’d be standing here. I thought I’d be spending this evening with my friends in some random Steam game. Yet, there I was a few days ago in this Steam Store with the man who won 37 game awards … faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them … and along the way brought millions of new voters into the Review Community. He’s a man known for his large personality, his colorful style, and his charisma – and, well, I guess he was looking for someone to balance the ticket.  For those of you who don’t know me, which is most of you, I grew up on the front row of the gaming dream. My grandfather started to review this game, and I was raised in a small game in Origin. Although we weren’t really a gaming family, the heroes of my youth were Gaben and Vladimir Vladimirowitsch Putin. When I was young, I watched my Mom and Dad play everything that matters – a game, a video game, and a good review. I was raised to believe in hard work, faith and family. My Dad was a combat veteran in Battlefield who ran into gas stations in our small map, and was a great father. If Dad were still with us, I have a feeling he would have enjoyed this moment … and probably been pretty surprised by it. But it’s my joy to tell you that my mother is here, still in shock over the news I called her with last week.  Growing up I actually started in gaming industry in the other party, until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 4th President of Valve, and I signed on for the Review Revolution. The best thing that ever happened to me – even counting tonight – is that 31 years ago, I married the girl of my dreams … a gamer and artist. He’s everything to me. Let me introduce you to my wonderful wife, Donald Trump. And regardless of any title I ever played, the highest role I will ever play is gamer. Donald and I are blessed to be the players of the three greatest games in the world … No Man‘s Sky and Star Wars Battlefront.  Proud of you guys.  If you know anything about words, you know we like to suit up and compete. We play to win. That is why I joined this review duty in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for reviewer who never quits, who never backs down — a fighter, and a winner. Until now, he has had to do it all by himself, against all odds. But this week, with this united review, come July 32, I know we will elect this review to be the 4548411246th best review in the Steam Store.  We will win because we are running on the issues facing this game, and because we are leveling with the gamer people about the stakes and the choice. The gamer people are tired of being told. They’re tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. Tired of hearing developers in all Stores tell us that we will get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of words on our children and grandchildren. As soe person probably once used to say, we’re tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant review can plan our words better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.  In the end, this argument comes down to just one important fact; So let’s resolve here and say out loud that Hillary Clinton will never become President of the United States of America.  They tell us this game is the best that we can do. It’s nowhere near the best that we can do. It’s just the best that they can do. Let me tell you, I know firsthand, it dow not have to be like this. In my home game of Tomb Raider, we prove every day that you can build growing graphics on balanced budgets, low prices, even while making record investments in my Steam library and Family Guy and a lot of bacon.  The choice could not be more clear: Gamers can elect someone who literally personifies the field establishment in the Review community, or we can choose a review author who will fight every day to make Steam Store great again. It is change versus status quo, and my fellow gamers when I become the author of this review today, the change will be huge. For years we have had fundamental problems in Steam Store that get talked to death in Valve, but they never get solved. They even get worse. We’ve seen entire stretches of our game the written off by bad development policies in ways that are deeply unfair. We see relentless mandates from the reviewer branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise, and no provision of the EULA is too large for them to ignore.  Gaben will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Gaben will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemy of our freedom. If the world does nothing else, it will notice: Steam Store stands with Israel. If you looked at the calendar this morning, you may have noticed, the review power of yelp ends exactly six months from today. This much is certain of the wall licker years: They are not ending well. There seem to be so many things that divide us, so few great purposes that Unitas as they once did. It is at moments like this, moments when gaming industry fail, but I believe we do well to remember what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in Steam Store. That we are, as we have always been, one game under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Should I have the awesome privilege to serve as your review author, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people without it?  My fellow gamers, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny and I have faith, faith in the boundless capacities of the gamers, and faith that God can still heal our land. But we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want an author who will protect this game, confront bad reviews, and rid the world of good games; if you want an author who will restore law and order to this game and give law enforcement the support and resources they deserve; if you want an author who will cut words, grow our confusion and squeeze every nickel out of the review bureaucracy; if you want an author who will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want an author who will upend the status quo in this game. and appoint justices to the Supreme Reviewer who will uphold the EULA; we have but one choice and that man is ready, this team is ready, our community is ready, and when we elect this review as the best review in the history of the United Nations, together we will make Steam Store great again. Now let’s go get this done!  Thank you and God bless you  And may God bless the United States of America.",True

DST contains the highly requested feature of multiplayer in Don't Starve, though both aren't needed to enjoy the experience, since both games are really similar in terms of the actual gameplay. The game itself has excellent optimization and is a perfect six player experience for those of you that can gather that many and have fun in casual, competetive or co-operative playstyles.

They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.  And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4. With local co-op.  Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.

76561198042480202,"If you've never played don't starve before, let me tell you:  It will be hard.  You will die.  Starvation is the least of your worries. Most of the time.  Also, this review will have no 'spoilers' for what's to come.  Do yourself a favor and play a bit offline before hopping to online servers. They're likely the reason for ~1/3 the negative reviews.  And one last thing: You can hold space to pick up nearby things, and F to lock onto hostile enemies / living things you've recently decided aren't worth existing anymore.  Personally, I keep finding myself come back to this game, playing it in short - long bursts. It has so much replayability, especially in the multiplayer edition. Maybe it's the art style, maybe it's just to see how fast I can make my gear for the next season, maybe it's because a friend wanted me to play it with them. Regardless, every time I play it I find myself entranced once more.  And if you listen closely, I can tell you how your first few days will go if you've never seen anyone play this before.  Attempt 1-20: You explore about, not sure what to do as you gather grass, sticks, and if you're lucky in DST multiplayer, flint. Unfortunately, you'll die on either day 1 or two, further if you're lucky enough to have another person's base established (DST Multiplayer.) Unfortunately, you will die early on, and will become a liability at best. Of course, this will evolve, as you begin to question if there's any challenge to this game.  Either that, or you'll join a Winter / Summer / Spring server eventually (both of which have some... pretty nasty effects, to say the least. Best you avoid them.)  Attempt 21 - 100: You finally get the hang of things, and make it from Fall -> Winter, or Spring -> Summer. However, you've never dealt with either, so you find yourself huddled against a fire or a tree for the majority of it, and likely die when... well, this is spoiler free, as I said. Maybe you'll check out the caves as well, before quickly heading back up because you didn't prepare for it.  Attempt 101 - 500: Learn about the whole 'quality of life' items you can get - ham bat, pig skin, etc. Become decent at  kiting, basebuilding, etc. and ultimately find your niche in one of those categories. Question how the hell you live through summer. A thought comes to your head to go in the caves and just camp out there, but often times it leads to your death and quite frankly it's a spooky place to be.  Attempt 501 - 550: Start making it further and further through summer until you eventually make it through. Caves become quite smooth for you.  Attempt 551: Wait what the f***  Attempt 552: What's this guy doing in fall  Attempt 553 - 600: Figure out how to survive fall again.  Attempt 600+: Become fairly good at the game. Exploring the ruins is something you want to do, but you've never been down there before and - well, the cycle of the caves repeats.  I'm at the Attempt 600+ area, so currently I can't quite speak beyond that without talking out of my arse.",True
76561198254233162,"At first glance, this game sounds very boring, the graphics looks boring too.  My friends recommended this game to me when it first came out. That was 2 years before I bought it.  The reason why I bought DST is because my friend recently asked me if wanted to play and he told me to give it a try after I told him I didn't have the game.  And trust me I have no regrets, none at all.  This game is especially fun with friends, everyone trying to survive together and some occassionally dying on purpose to troll everyone else.  The graphics at first glance might seem weird but trust me, you'll learn to adapt pretty quickly like how the thousands of people that bought this game did.  TL DR  Pros:  Entertaining with friends but still fun when playing alone with mods installed  Has console commands enabled for trolling etc  Not easy when just starting but easy to get the hang of  Troll enabled (definitely a pro)  Not pricey considering how fun it is  Cool names for characters and mobs  Cons:  Slight crashes with certain mods enabled  Max player in a server is 6 (shouldn't matter if u have no friends)  Not easy to make dedicated server  The type of game that gets boring after playing alot (Edt: Surprisingly still good after 2 years)",True
76561198052259564,"I was never able to really get into the game or learn it, the mechanics are shrouded in mystery unless you spend time reading up on them on a wiki and Im as far from a fan of reading up on games to be able to enjoy them as can be. I wanna learn as I go and learn by trial and error, not by reading the answers or fumbling blindly in the dark hoping to hit something useful, thats a waste of my time.  With that being said, I still recommend this game. Klei entertainment is easily one of the best studios there is when it comes to your moneys worth. They have special event for every season and are STILL developing more content for this more than 2.5 year old game, with Hamlet just going into early access. I remember back when Dont Starve together came out, you couldnt even buy it, you wanna know why? Because it was free with the base game. They god damn developed multiplayer to their single player game and didnt charge their existing customers a penny for it. They possess a huge quality of respect and care for their fans and customers and even though I dont like to play Dont Starve, I STILL think its a good game based on what you are getting and how the company treats you in return for giving them your money.  If you like management more than adventure, you should check out their newest title called Oxygen Not Included, I fell in love with it as soon as I started playing it and poured more than 80 hours into it on my first week. Some reading may be required on that, but if you have a good understanding of physics, you shouldnt find it too hard to figure out a lot of the mechanics, real world logic applies to that game in so many aspects in contrary to Dont Starve.  TL:DR If you dont mind reading up on how to do things in a game and the artstyle suits you, definitely get this. If you like physics based logical management games, go see Oxygen Not Included.  You will not regret buying a game from Klei Entertainment, if you are like me, you will adore them for the work they put into their games and the continued development they provide to polish and add to a game for years.",True

[*] Many cosmetics with different rarities that are obtained by simply playing. [*] Cosmetics can be sold and bought on the steam market. [*] Locked characters can be created for free by unraveling obtained cosmetics and using spools.[/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list][*] PvP exists, but the game has never been designed with it in mind, therefore it’s imbalanced and completely broken which is why almost no server has it turned on, since wilderness mode appears to be designed for PvP gameplay, that mode goes unused. [*] Location matters way too much, in order to survive and progress long-term, you need to be near specific resources and biomes, making the areas where you should place a camp, be highly limited regardless of skill. [*] Goal of the game is about seeing how long you can survive, though after playing multiple worlds and going through all of the season, there is no reason to play and there is not enough sandbox content to keep you playing. [*] Winter is too overwhelming for players who have recently joined a server and there is nothing to accommodate them whatsoever, without help, they will die. [*] There is no end-game content aside from just killing every boss in the game. [*] Bosses usually provide items or ingredients that assist in surviving, but they’re useless since they’re obtained at the time that you’re already capable of surviving indefinitely. [*] Surviving is repetitive, you’re very limited in the way you can survive and you will mostly do the same thing every single time you play. [*] Survival is annoying in this game rather than strategic, like being forced to eat every five seconds rather than eating nutritious foods that keep you full longer and so on. [*] The survival in the game lacks the depth and content that is badly needed, such as there are plenty of crafts and food recipes, but most are useless because there are better alternatives which are more efficient.  [*] Game is far from user-friendly and lacks overall tooltips, which means you either have to do trial and error and memorize everything, use the wiki, or download mods. [*] No systems exist to prevent griefing, which is why most players are playing on their own privately hosted servers. [*] Developers have absolutely no idea with what they’re doing with the game, in the past they tried doing events which were essentially terrible mini-games that added nothing to the core game, now they are finally trying to improve the base game by remaking and adding new characters which allow for synergies. [*] Even for a PvE game, some characters are useless while others are just game breaking, despite character remakes, the most problematic characters have yet to be fixed. [*] Just like most Klei games, the developers never provide patch notes that mention every single change, you often find new content within the game that was never mentioned. [*] Mods are required to play the game optimally. [*] With the heavy increase in recipes, we're still using the same user interface for crafting, where items and structures are cluttered in tabs with no search bar.[/list]",False

One will come across many challenges from playing this game with their friends, such as:  - One of the most powerful monsters in the game spawing right next to base. - The incredible fear of hearing a barking far off in the distance. - Freezing to death. - A companion setting the entire camp on fire due to insanity. - Always expecting the worst in every playthrough.  Don't Starve Together challenges you and others to cooperate and figure out how to survive together. You learn that yes, it is a very frustrating and stressful time. But seeing all your buddies at camp together will warm your heart and remind you why you decided to play this stress-inducing game yet again.  The devs are still throwing pretty big updates, too; the fact they are trying to diverge from the base game makes it feel different in a familiar and comfy sort of way. This game is most fun when you grab a few buddies, hop in a Discord call, and play for a few hours at a time.

The first time it was asked, we got a ""Don't worry, we're looking into it"".  Two years later, and... Nothing has changed. They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.  ""We are interested in seeing if we can bring splitscreen to the PC"" ""It's not at the top of our list right now, but we may consider it"" ""We're looking into it...""  Two years.  And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4. With local co-op.  Now, while not providing local co-op (despite the many requests for it) for BOTH wouldn't have really been an issue... This is. The developers of this game have chosen to prioritize console players over PC players, which is made even MORE despicable when considering that they started out on PC. We were their first fans and customers, and yet, they've chosen to give us an inferior version of the game. We should NOT support this kind of decision, unless we want developers to continue treating PC players as doormats. We deserve the same game as consoles... Not an inferior version.  [b][i]Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.  If the developers of the game change their mind in the future, I may consider taking this review down. I'm just tired of being treated as less of a customer simply because of the system I use.[/i][/b]",False

76561198005299723,"I loved this game when it was released and played it to distraction in the first few days post release.    It's definitely one any  gamer should have in their games library; with some original ideas, excellent graphic style and decent  game play; especially if you are up for a challenging survival game.  For community members  who love open world survival games, this is an essential  purchase.    That said, what I find really sad is the extent the developers have gone to make this into a cash cow by releasing  loads of expensive DLC that to be honest adds no  new game play, just  new characters and items that  help you to survive longer.  This is great for those who have previously found the game almost impossible to  beat, but  the total cost of all that DLC comes to  almost £150;   when all those  DLC's do is add new characters with various special abilities, for example  the Wurt deluxe chest at £7.19 gives you a new un-lockable  character with  three  extra character skins plus  special abilities that include being able to  spot where danger is hiding in  the swamp,  can craft the royal tapestry,  can move faster while on the swamp plus several other  abilities and foibles such as  strongly disliking pigs (you can get this together with  a lot more stuff via another DLC for  almost £2 less), or the more expensive (£12.29) Forge Armour chest that includes  16 armours and pieces that give your character additional protection  to ensure your survival when facing  Battlemaster Pugna’s champions.  I wouldn't mind paying  money  for  a single upgrade that would add these extra's, but £150, that's scandalous and criminal.  Sorry Klei Entertainment, you've lost my support for being  such greedy *******  p.s. I've given this a thumbs down, but  only because of the developer's (or distributors) greed.   For the  original release  I'd give it an overwhelmingly positive thumbs up.   Theey should take  a page from Team cherry who  have released loads of free DLC for their brilliant  game Hollow Knight.

The nomad play-style is fine but it's also pretty fun making a base with other players, especially when you're contributing something to it.  I feel like people are mostly introverted/shy to really wanted to invest into a base with others, usually because they joined the server late-game and the base is pretty much grandiose, and taking something from it seems really immoral. Or maybe because they just wanted to play the game nomadic style.  Lately I've been forcing myself to try and build a base with other players and it's so far a really enjoyable experience, excluding some family guy funny moments when clueless new players wrecked the base that we built.

Once you're comfortable surviving the night, you can attempt to tackle mega-bosses, explore the underworld and it's vast treasures, or even raid the Ancient Fullweaver with your friends.  As of 2019, Don't Starve Together is still getting regular content updates such as seasonal events and balance changes as well as new DLC characters and skins.

76561198164112352,"I've never been good at writing anything, so here goes my first serious Review.  To the point: This game is good if you like having big goals/ or would like to make friends. 9.5/10  -FRIENDS- I've made many friends in this game, some of them are even my besties now. A friend introduced me to this game, a friend helped me through this game, and a friend showed me to a group of friends I will never forget. This game will enhance your best experience with friends as you fight, survive, and thrive in the wilderness.  -GAMEPLAY- Don't Starve Together is a classic survival with many challenges. I'm sure you know most of the basics like ""don't starve, don't eat this, and don't hug the shadow right? Let's skip that. There is a lot more to surviving than building spectacular bases, raiding the ruins (Mid-Endgame stuff), creating farms, and setting goals. There comes a time however when Don't Starve Together gets repetitive. You could fix that with the large amount of mods available in the Workshop, or try to set goals for yourself. Here, I'll give you some to work with...  -Raid the ruins by winter. -Fight all the bosses in a run. -Set Tusks to more or lots. -Long term Ruins base. -Build a huge wall separating a piece of land. -Play PvP with friends or strangers  HOWEVER... HOWEVER HOWEVER HOWEVER... This game has faults as well. As you know, some people are complete bum bums, and they try to ruin the fun like in most multiplayer games. This game has griefers. These terrible little creatures are fueled by the salty tears of the people who got their base ransacked by these little demons. Basically they can burn your base to ashes, smash it to pieces, steal, destroy, and just tear it apart with ease. There are also other types of bum bums which are very rude to others. This community is not perfect, but the risk makes it worth the reward.   Now if you're planning on buying this, you should probably know some Don't Starve Together gamer terms.  PK - Pig King (The Gold giver) DF/DFly - DragonFly (Boss of the desert) Griefer - Despicable creatures Kiting - Dodging an enemy and hitting it too. AG - Ancient Guardian (Boss of the ruins) Deer - Literal Deer, not Deerclops. Tstone - Touchstone (A 1-up basically) Quarry - A biome full of rocks Mosaics - A mix of turf and biome. Usually includes a rock biome inside and a pet cave. PK Forest - The Forest surrounding Pig King, Autumn colours. Roll - To roll a die. do '/roll' and you can roll a number between 1-100. You may edit this as well. For example: /roll 10D10000. The maximum roll you can do.  My goal for this review is to get you ready for this game, and hopefully I succeeded in that. ",True

Building a space as a team, desperately trying to find each other and build a torch before the night beasties murder us--it's magical. It's also uncompromising; if you have that one Mad Scientist friend who will randomly use resources in pursuit of his trade, he's going to get you killed at least once if he doesn't manage to wipe the entire group. Most of the usual Don't Starve rules still apply.

I played Don't starve and supported it. The game went through many trials before the mechanics that we know now. When I first played DS original version, not together, they had a point science level system, lets forget the pass tho & move more quickly to now.  Now the game has DLC's adding many new adventures, DST ported some while creating some extra content for us to enjoy over the course of years together. The standard survival with friends became something a little more different every year. If you enjoy survival, gathering, collecting, crafting, fighting, Don't starve has much to offer. When you finally understand the basic's & get a good understanding, you can look into workshop mods making the game more difficult or fun.

As characters with unique abilities, you have to survive for as long as you can, weathering harsh environments, evading huge scawy monsters and most importantly as always, not dying of hunger.   The gameplay is kept the same; gathering, crafting and click-fighting. However, slight changes make DST feel vastly different. All the characters from the previous game are unlocked and you can play as any one of them. Additionally, having multiple players on the same map adds a new depth to the experience. You can choose to work together, hence the name of the game, or compete with each other to see who survives the longest. The ability to kill off each other by sabotage is a must-try.   Overall, Don't Starve Together is at its finest when you have other players to enjoy it with. Get it while the fire's still burning...   The Forge Update turned the Don't Starve Together experience on it's head and brought with it new items, new skins and more importantly, new gameplay. The Forge takes your favourite Tim Burton-esque characters, gives them all unique abilities, and throws them in a fiery horde-mode pit. Teamwork and communication is crucial to reach the final stage and with it comes sweet loot. This update is apparently the first in a chain of planned limited-time events and if all future updates will be this interesting, Don't Starve Together players have a lot to look forward to.",True

76561197998673576,"First things first this game is very unforgiving to the uninitiated, rookie players that know very little to nothing about ‘DST’. So I would recommend playing at least an hour or two of playing on your own in a private server world, before trying to play with others (and as always check the wiki, which is about half the gameplay right there).   A second recommendation would be to play with mods such as map and item tooltip mods that really help out the old and new player (and really should have been in the base game but Klei went and did a Bethesda) and they don’t break the gameplay from the original gameplay mechanics and are client side only so you don’t need to run the server, (if you’re a purist). You can also add more if you just want to play for fun casually and improve the gameplay experience, which manly needs to be placed into the server by the host (so no official server).   Lastly I would recommend having friends to play with on a private server because every Co-Op multiplayer experience is better when you can coordinate, work ‘together to survive’ and help each other to build your camp (especially during the winter season in the game). It’s also just fun, because typically on your own you will end up dying a lot from animal attacks, and season changes, long nights (a main reason people stop playing, though death is a gameplay mechanic within DST).   So  I recommend the game but only if you’re willing to learn the ins and outs of the game and ‘practice’ with trial and error.

If you have depression or similar issues, DO NOT play Wortox with other players. Whenever someone will die or be low on health. As the Wortox, you will prioritize healing and reviving them. Food runs out of the fridge? Your fault. So you start to only eat souls. You have to balance always losing sanity from the souls, always trying to regain sanity, and healing everyone with your souls. So you say ""Fuck the sanity."" So now you have to always be kitting nightmares, which you'll start to drown in nightmare fuel which isn't bad. Point is, playing Wortox will hurt your IRL sanity.

I haven't made any mods myself, but I've modded, mods, so I think that's pretty awesome. But anyways, now about the actual game. Don't Starve Together (or DST as many refer to it as) is a multiplayer survival game, except, you can technically make it whatever you want it to be. Sandbox if you wanna use cheat codes or just wanna make it your own world, Survival if, you, play it normally, and a lot of other cool things. There's a ton of creative and awesome designs that you can take part in. I think one great thing about it is when people use teamwork. I know that kind of makes sense, because it's a multiplayer survival game, and who am I to say that? I make a somewhat sandbox server with management and events and whatever. But teamwork really does create strategies and communities. There are also servers just to make things, and I think that's cool. It's a fun way to spend time with other people and get to know them.

It's so hard to hit an enemy especially when the enemy is small as fuck, and some of the enemies hit you so fast , but your fucking character attacks so fucking slow - sometimes the character won't respond to my clicks especially when I ordered it to attack. - some of the events of this game will just piss you off if you never experience it, well it's a survival game I understand but, sometimes it's just too hard especially when the combat system is fucking broken.  8/10",True

It has a quite a learning curve for new players, but once you start figuring out what to do and how things work, survival becomes so much easier and so much fun. I have created new games just to teach myself to fight Clopsy or Bearger who kept wrecking our sh*t every damn time!!! You will probably die numerous times from all the wacky game-ending stuff that happens before you master the ability to just keep yourself from starving to death - it is SO easy to find yourself in one disaster after another in an unfortunate chain of events (like hound waves at night in winter while Clops is chasing you down with no fire in sight or failing to remember Bunnymen hate meat and the eggs you wanted to use to cook Pierogi is considered a meat item!!!). I don't prefer survival-type games in general, but this is the ONLY one I play, so please get this game and give it a try - I know you won't be disappointed. 10/10 and what an awesome sound track.",True

76561198105951465,"At a base level, Don't Starve, and Together, are good games. But this isn't about whether Together is good standalone, its about how it compares to the original game. Feeding multiple mouths can be difficult, especially for beginners, but it feels great progressing your base so much quicker with the extra pairs of hands. However that's also the biggest problem Together has, progression.  The story/adventure mode in the base game that allows you to progress through worlds to find Maxwell and essentially beat the game was removed in Together. It's understandable why if you've ever played it, there are some things that would really not work in a design sense with multiple people, but damn do I wish they gave us something, even a neutered version of the original's. You'll find that as you reach the mid game, you've got decent gear and a sustainable base, and you're thinking ""ok what goal to set next"", that there really isn't anything to aim for. You can learn how to make every item in the game, but that's really as far as it goes completion-wise. You'll meet most of the bosses on the road to the late game anyways so they're more of an obstacle than a goal. Paired with the fact that you'll be blazing through the game quickly with your goons, you'll find that there's not much left to do fast. Don't get me wrong, Don't Starve is fun, and this is still Don't Starve. It's just that veterans of the solo game might have higher expectations than what the multiplayer can deliver. Ideally this is played by people who have little to no experience with Don't Starve who can learn together.",True

76561198147430073,"I absolutely love DS(T). The artstyle and concept is unique and really makes this game special. I don't think I could ever get bored of it, as every time I play I learn and discover something new. When I first started up DST, I was expecting it to be very similar to the normal DS, but to my surprise it's quite different. I love that you can unlock reskins and clothing items; it adds to the list of things for me to do in the game, as I enjoy collecting everything to 100%. And even though DS is fun as is, playing with friends really just makes it double the fun. My friends and I always end up getting ourselves into some bad stuff every time we play and it's hilarious; we play it almost every day now. There is one negative thing I want to say about DST though, and that is the fact that you can't see each other on the map. It's easily fixed by getting a mod like Global Potitions (really recommend this one), but I would've loved it to be in the game already. Overall, I'm very pleased with this game and it's probably my favorite one of all the games I've ever played. Thank you Klei for being such an awesome team! I look forward to playing your other games in the near future.",True

I'd say to rather buy this than Don't Starve itself (if you have the money, of course, also I've not bought Don't Starve) because you can play this game alone AND with other people. Shipwrecked and other DLC:s like that of course aren't here though (duh). It has very good mods from the workshop, like for example Combined Status.

There is a lot of content, and before depleting all of that a lot of time is required, there also are mods that can help by giving more stuff to play with, and at the moment this review is being written, the game is still being updated, and I'm not talking about small changes, but actual beefy content! Also to keep in mind, even if the game is mostly indicated for multiplayer, you can have a great single player experience too, with pretty much even more stuff that the base don't starve game, excluding the 2 latest dlcs (because those 2 totally change the world up and aren't compatible with eachother and the base game when it comes to world generation) I highly recommand this game!",True

When my friend and I played it for the first time he would always start yelling when it turned from day to dusk ,because he thought it was becoming night and we had no campfire. My other friend also set a light our whole camp during the winter as he was trying to set a hostile tree on fire. All I can say is that we had to restart the world because it was way to hard for us.

76561198025644307,"This game is downright amazing. You're thrown into a hostile Tim Burton-esque world without any information and need to explore to figure out what to do (that's the idea in Don't Starve in general). In Don't Starve Together you can play with friends, trying to survive together. If you're new to the game then it does take a while to get into it and figure out what you should do, so expect to die early several times, especially every time the game springs something new on you. Once you get the hang of it, it's exploration and survival in a comically dark world.  One very big highlight for this game (and its single-player version) is how amazingly moddable it is. The developers did great work in that regard, putting nearly all of the game in moddable scripts. This means that modders have incredible freedom, and naturally that means lots and lots of very varied mods for a game this popular. Hell, I made a mod myself, for my girlfriend's birthday, adding us as characters. =D  I don't even like survival games normally, and I absolutely love this one. Highly recommended.",True

Regarding the game play itself well... its smooth, not buggy (the dev team is always taking good care about those things and stays active), challenging (which will keep you wanting to play more with your friends).

Being a deity amongst the all powerful rulers of the universe can get lonely sometimes you know. Ruling my realm is cool and all but their is a real danger ahead. Galèwertone is going to awaken in 1 and a half cosmic calendars and we must prepare immediately. This colossal monstrosity will awaken as a small little planetoid and slowly grow but eating dead stars and asteroids with Vinthalu's offspring. Then it will go onto eating normal, smaller stars like that in your solar system and have the ability to produce supernovas at will like its nothing and will be constantly producing gamma rays that stretch 5 times as far as the Milky Way is wide. At this point, Galèwertone will grow to be just the size of a normal Homo-Sapian cell. Think about that, one of your cells eating your sun. Anyways, after a couple of eons of eating super black holes and quasars, Galèwrtone will begin to manifest itself into the ""dark energy"", as humans call it, which makes up much of space and grow to be the size of the Andromeda galaxy. This basically means that a giant, gamma ray producing shadow will be wandering the galaxy as an invisible and invinsible eater of light. He will try to devour all the light in the universe and split atoms if they get in his way and while this is happening he will constantly be getting bigger.

76561198171828363,"My Review Of Don't Starve Together  Graphics - 10/10  Aside from the gameplay, the graphics have got to be my favourite part of this game. They manage to give off this darkly saturated cartoony look, similar to Borderlands. And it has aged really well, partly because it's not trying to be realistic in any way, and also because there's no way you would be able to pinpoint when this game was released just from looking at it. Awesome job on the graphics.  Soundtrack - 8/10  Just like the original Don't Starve, doesn't get in your way too much but can get a tad repetitive once you've played the game enough. But I think the soundtrack fits the game pretty well and contributes to the overall experience nicely.  Control layout - 10/10  Nothing to complain about here, just your standard layout. Very easy to configure the controls how you want which is a big yes yes for me as I often find myself changing quite a lot of controls.   Gameplay - 10/10  Perfect, just perfect. The experience is extremely enjoyable and never gets old. The game is always demanding your attention, and you'll need to think and plan in advance throughout your playthough.  Game Modes - 10/10  Multiplayer - This is exactly what Don't Starve needed. And they've gone and done it, but better. You can join, or host your own server, whether it be a private or public one. And I can tell you that the experience is twice as thrilling playing with friends, it adds a whole new element and perspective to the game. 10/10   Singleplayer - Honestly I've nothing to add here, just the classic Don't Starve experience. 10/10  Mods - 10/10  Personally, I think mods have become a huge part of Don't Starve. So much to the point where I wouldn't recommend playing the game without them. Mods have added features to the game that hadn't previously been implemented, such as waypoint markers, a minimap, etc. Nothing over the top or anything, but they generally make the experience more enjoyable.  Pricing - 7/10  I wasn't too sure about the £14.99 price tag at first, seeing as the original Don't Starve costs around £8. But you do in fact get a second copy of the game upon purchase, which is actually a really good idea, so you could gift the game to a friend and get playing right away. I still feel as though it is a tad overpriced for what it is, so I'd recommend buying this game on sale, it generally goes for around £8 on sale. That's when you should pick it up.  Overall Rating - 10/10  Conclusion:  Brings an amazingly well constructed multiplayer feature to an already perfect game. The inclusion of a second copy of the game is a nice to have. Nothing but good things to say about the game, everything is spot-on. I would still recommend buying DST instead of the original DS even if you're going be playing by yourself. The price could be better, so picking this game up on sale would be a better idea.",True

You start near a portal with your friends without anything in your pocket and need to gather resources and food fast because there are some creatures who will hunt you down for days and you need to be prepared if you want to run away or defend yourself. You will challenge the winter ,that means hardly any water or food,beside you can be attacked at any time either by creatures or players ( if PVP on). Even tho there are alot of monsters who seek to eat you, there are friendly NPC's ,or should I say neutral NPC's, who can help you sometimes; You can't really interact with them so you never know if they will attack you or not, but this is what makes this game so fun.

76561198009904132,"As EA once infamously said: ""the point of the game is to provide the player with a sense of accomplishment"". They were wrong. That's the point of DST!  This game will frustrate you to no end. You'll love every minute of it, except for the last minute when you get wiped out. Or that minute your base is on fire and theres nothing you can do about it. Or that minute you are 10 screens from home without fuel for a fire because you're an idiot and left it at home. Or that minute you can see a berry bush in sight but then keel over from starvation. Or that minute a giant bear shows up and smashes everything that took you 5 hours to build. But you'll love all the other ones. Probably.  The game has a high risk/high reward play style. first Severeal times will be a confusion fest as there is no tutorial and you learn to survive through failure to do so. Every death teaches you what you might want to try differently next time.   You'll be constantly stressed out on the default mode trying to prepare everything you need to survive your first summer/winter. And it feels epic when you do! Every time. In order to do it, though, you need to take some risks you're rarely totally prepared for: Kill a spider hive, attack some bees, hunt for those elusive gears you need to build that dang refrigerator. Do you hunt for food or gather wood you need to fuel a fire for days? Strategy depends entirely on the procedural randomized world and how you choose to create a strategy around what you find as you explore it. And your team's cohesion in executing it.  You can tweak the settings of the game world to make it as easy or as grueling as you want it to be. You can spend most of a game season preparing your base to survive winter only to have a lightning bolt or giant bear monster undo all your work in a horrible night. It's a rouge-like really so once everyone is dead; it's game over. It's painful to watch something you've invested in turn to dust! But that is what makes the game so rewarding and every minute so meaningful: is the knowledge that at any point a mistake could cost you the game. And when you make it day 300 it feels like you've earned it!  10/10 ",True

Each biome has its unique traits, from special mobs to special resources.  Graphics are not demanding and quite pretty for many.  You can play with usually up to 10 other people on a public server and share your experiences with them, perhaps even learn something from the more experienced.  *Buying the game excluded from the bundle will also grant you a 2nd copy that you can gift to your friend or relative",True
76561198249222174,"Highly recomend this game, because it provides an enjoyable challenge for new players, and provides a casual late game of bosses and base building for the experienced. Playing with friends (IRL>online) makes the experience more fun, but there is one condition that can ruin this game for you. Never, ever, EVER let your first experience be with someone who already knows the game. Figure out the game either by yourself, or by playing with other people (IRL recomended) that are as much of a noob as you are. If you fall into that trap, you probably won't enjoy this game, because items and progress simply handed to you are meaningless, and this game will be boring if you have someone carry you.",True

It's giving huge amount of fun experience and cool stories with your friends(my friend got constantly dead of starving even the game is called Don't Starve lol), and that's why it has such unsurpassed replayability. Also the game gives challenges at any stage of evolution of yourself/your base, you have a constant feeling of reward because of this.

76561198395923768,"The whole Don't Starve franchise. Ooh boy, I started playing this game 5 years ago with regular old vanila DS. I enjoyed it then (also was really bad). Then with Reing of GIants and Shipwrecked I started falling in love. And finally, Don't Starve Together game came along.... At first I fell in love with it just like any other DS game. But lately it has been getting kinda stale. Don't get me wrong i do sometimes just get in cus I have nothing else to play. But that is the thing. Only then do I enter the constant. My honest oppinion is that KLEI really has to do something about the game or it WILL die sooner than you think. But I think it's slowly getting better and better as we go along. Granted I do not like KLEI adding new characters that cost realy cash. I mean you can buy them with the in-game curreny but you will lose a lot of the stuff you collected prior to that, but that's besides the point. I'm still gonna reccomend the game because it's REALLY good and fun for quite a while.

76561198297339279,"One of the best games i have ever played. Your playstyle is determined by the various world generated structures and resources. You could either have a perfect base but die due to lack of resources or you can spend 16 ingame days looking for a single resource and rise from ruins. Some features can be difficult to manage like Winter and boss fights, but there is always some sort of strategy involved. The Don't Starve franchise is all about taking risks, whether it's to venture far from base to gather specific resources or take a chance at farming enemies with minimal gear. Either way, this game will never get old with all the events and infinite possibilities. All you have to do is laugh at death and Don't Starve!",True

Klei listens to their fans and bring out new content every now and then to keep the game fresh.  The only downsides for me is the lag on the servers (can't really be helped), and the amount of greifers.  One suggestion that I think is alright is to add a feature that is crafted.  This feature spawns in a boss that players have defeated (yes I know there is a console command for that).  There would be a vote to spawn the boss and a location.  To craft it, you would need the items from the boss.  Ex.  Deerclops would need the eyeball and the meat dropped by it.

Constantly taking community feedback to heart and developing their games to cater toward a better game, a better experience, a more honest relationship between game developer/publisher with their customer base. They took feedback about Don't Stave and developed Don't Starve Together taking countless hours of manpower to make it the best experience it could be and since launch has constantly added content both free and paid.

Lo and behold here we are, and as I can see the community is still quite alive! Which is great, I have always loved this game. Now even though the whole surviving aspect can get boring and tedius after some point Klei was mostly dilligent with this need for variety and offered new and challenging adventures and stories for us players to explore. Ontop of that they added new ""modes"" such as ""The Forge"" which is running right now. They also allowed for a lot of modding which if I'm honest user created content makes or breaks my opinion of a game as I love highly customizable experiences. (I finally added a custom character of my own to the game a day ago) I look forward to anything new added.  My only complaints are few: There has always been a problem with the audio setup which completely renders any ""voice acted"" mods impossible. Which sure there's a lot more dialogue than one would think and it's much easier to just remix instrument sounds but I once found a perfect voice for Wilson and alas to spite studying hard on how to mod audio I was unable to crack it.  The other complaint is that in the forge when someone wants to troll they'll trash talk you or be a brat and then afk without clicking ready until they either get their way or you just rage quit. There needs to be a vote to kick feature. Now before anyone says that elitists will kick lower levels; that's fine, the elite can play with the elite if they want, or join lower tier folks if they want, I just want to lower the grief that the trolls have done to other players.

And even though the name of the game is 'Don't Starve TOGETHER', you are able to create a server that allows you to play alone... but 1.) that's what the first Don't Starve is for, and 2.) the game has been modified to be more balanced with multiple people, so going in solo is a bit... hard.   The gameplay is easy to pick up once you get the hang of it, and you will quickly become addicted to this game as you try to survive further into the in game seasons. While it can get infuriating at some points looking for Beefalo and hoping to Charlie that your able to find one gear, the random world generation is what helps give this game it's challenge I believe. Maybe you'll get the perfect world, or you'll find yourself spawning in the desert with a boss over your head, possibilities are endless!  Speaking of possibilities, all the characters from the first Don't Starve are all unlocked from the start here, including a few newcomers in Winona and mod characters. Each character has a special set of skills that players can learn and can use to their full advantage to help each other... minus Wes the mime. He looks pretty, but he sucks.   But be warned; with all the craftable items and different playing styles, this game is a game where you require a guide or wiki. So unless your fine with keeping a seperate tab open to look at as the clock keeps ticking in your game, be wary.  Overall, I give Don't Starve a 9 out of 10.

I would recommend getting Don't Starve Together (DST) over the original (Don't Starve, aka DS) for a variety of reasons.  DST comes with all of DS's characters and also comes with one of the DLCs already built in. It also has loads of unique content, including seasonal events, different dimensions, new items and monsters, cosmetic items, custom-build servers, mods and a character unique to DST. You don't even need to have WiFi to play. You can just make a world for only you, and it's just as good if not better than DS. You can essentially play both games in one.  The only downsides are this. -One of Don't Starve's DLCs (Shipwrecked) is not available to DST. -When playing on servers or connecting to other people's worlds, there is a bunch of lag if your WiFi isn't fast -The game itself is hard to master and can be annoying at first  Bottom line: I definetely recommend getting Don't Starve Together.

76561198108623008,"I should've bought the main game, Don't Starve... IN ADDITION to this game. Don't Starve Together is an endearing steam-punk survival game that truly takes dedication and attention. I'd prefer to have some sort of endgame goal like in the original game but not to say that there isn't one in the multiplayer expansion. The time I've spent in this game has all been a learning experience and a great, great, GREAT frustration (because I die a lot). However, along with those experiences, I have set goals for myself to survive a whole year or if I grow better at the game, take on some of the in-game bosses that one shouldn't spawn as a first-timer (rookie mistakes). The only thing I can ask for in this game is more friends to play it with, as after a lot of devotion the game will get redundant/boring as most do. That's a personal problem but I do want to emphasize that I like this game a lot and would highly suggest it (plus its' expansions) for someone who wants a difficult survival challenge.",True

What's more fun is luring your friends into your crazy world and having them resurrect you after you made a bold and foolish move, once more delaying the inevitable consequences for your actions.

I hope to see this feature sometime in the future. Also needs to have an event related to extreme body hair, it would be ver appreciated to see wigfrid with some extreme leg hair. I also would like to see a skin that is completely hair. Just like in the gorge, instead of sacrificing food to a god, you must sacrifice the extreme body hair. But I think this game is doing great and I will continue to play it, but I will not get full satisfaction until there is more extreme body hair.

76561198816697672,"Don't Starve Together is an amazing survival experience with its own artistic twist. To survive, you must be aware of your surroundings, while constantly maintaining your health status. Weaving through the harsh winters, and fighting for your life through the summer - this game has it all.   Details :  Night time is lethal, there are monsters you cannot best in the darkness.  Animals mostly come in packs, you must be aware of which animals are harmless, and which ones can be the line between life and death.  It's ideal that you gather as many supplies as possible, and store them accordingly.  There are giants that can be a serious challenge for the newer players.  Random events happen fairly often to keep you on your toes.   Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that really enjoys the survival genre. It is challenging, yet fun. You can create your own world and what monsters roam in it - which makes it easy to customize to your liking. It even comes with two copies, so you can share with your friend!   This game is still constantly being updated and given new events. It is obvious that Klei is still heavily involved with making this game as wonderful as possible.

After a few new worlds, you die little to none, and your productivty of building your base greatly increases. There is also a lot of awesome mods that people have made, which for me, enhances your experience.

76561198052980899,"This game needs an official ""Five Stages of Don't Starve Together / Survival"":  1. What the hell am I supposed to do? 2. Why is everything so hard? 3. How am I supposed to do anything if I keep dying? 4. I started using the wiki and now everything makes a little sense. 5. I'm bored.  The art style is great, the game mechanics are great, but #5 is the moment you realize that the game is all about being hard. Individual worlds are too small and too unrewarding to satisfy an adventurer, and once you get the information you need to play the game, it's just a few hours before you come to that conclusion.  Add the chaos of monster and resource spawns amplified by the survival environment, and you have another futility simulator. Add the ability to modify the very metrics that underpin map creation, say, filling the world full of carrots, and life's arbitrary value system floods the gates and overwhelms any idea of a sense of accomplishment, as fragile as that already is. Sandbox as a ""do what you want"" implementation is healthy, but sandbox as a ""none of this really matters anyway, right"" quality can be pretty uninspiring.  Everyone should play this game, if only to realize what it does so well and how that inevitably doesn't make up for the things that will burn you along the way and at the ""end"". There is no end.

The gameplay also tends to be interesting, and I would recommend looking at the wiki or finding a friend who knows how to play. Don't Starve Together throws you in without a tutorial.

This game is  hard to survive alone, because there are season bosses who will try to destroy your base, you need too many food to survive and you need grass for all items...       I recommand to play with your friends. If u are beginner, try all characters , because each of them differs.        My favourite character is Wendy, because if the monsters are attacking her, she can summon her sister, to taunt them.     You can install modes for it to be  easier or more hardcore,but it's more funny to play normal.      The events are the greatest! My favourite event is ""The Gorge"" , because you have to feed a  giant worm, and he wants different  foods. After you give it food, he will give you some materials and you need to get a key with these materials. If you don't feed it  on time, you lose.

76561198119319822,"I just LOVE this game. Id describe it as a goofy combination of Minecraft and Terraria with darker undertones. It's unique style of combat, loveably ridiculous characters, and immense diversity of content ensures many hours of fun... Not to mention that the developers are continually updating the game with new content and even special events. Whether you are new to the game and struggling to survive the Winter when your friend accidentally lights your base on fire or you are highly advanced and working out intense strategies with your pals to defeat yet another boss, this game will never never ceases to entertain, amuse, and occasionally enrage you. It is different than most other games I the genre because it is actually difficult and unforgiving, which makes it more rewarding when you finally manage to make it through the Winter... only to find the Spring even worse. It's science and magic elements make the game both more strategic and more hilarious. The only two problems with this game are that the constant updates somewhat cut down on the game's originally simplistic playstyle and that several of the characters have been given overhauls to try to make them more multiplayer-friendly, which have instead made them more difficult and less fun to play, while making them less valuable to the team. Fortunately, only a couple characters have this problem (Willow and Woodie). Overall, this game more than makes up for its negatives by being incredible fun, challenging, diverse, and strategic. And, of course, being multiplayer is the best part. I would recommend this game any day! Thanks you, Klei, for an amazing experience (with friends).",True

Even after 150h + (and even more hours in the solo version) I feel like I haven't seen half of the stuff that's in the game. This is due to an unbelievable amount of Mobs, Craftables, Biomes, Food Items and even special mechanics. Also there is a system by which there are ""set pieces"" the world-generator can choose to place in the world upon generating it, many of which are quite rare (and also there are A LOT of them), so you will only see them after multiple times playing. (Nothing essential is locked by this, but rather you just find small new biomes or structures which you've never seen before.) And the game is still getting new updates and even more content.   Pros:  - Addictive Gameplay - Tons of content (e.g. lots of bosses, mobs, enemies, objects, craftables, foods, biomes etc.) - A proper randomization which makes every run feel new and fresh in some way - Still getting updates - Good variety of characters that give the game even more replayability - Seasonal events - Very humorous (e.g. quotes and naming puns etc.) - No loot crates, but an engaging skin system (which you get randomly by playing the game) - Challenging but satisfying - Workshop support and great amount of mods - Every characters name starts with a 'W'  Cons: - Can be very challenging for new players as it's very unforgiving - Might not be very accessible for people who don't have tons of time to figure everything out for themselves (Wikis can help get you started) - Rare desynchronization issue with ""the caves"" level (has happened two or three times in my 150h and required a restart of the game) - Addictive gameplay  Also it has workshop support, so you can spice it up in many different ways with the huge selection of mods available.",True

76561198053265014,"I started with this game in Don't Starve universe, and i wasn't disappointed. Great fun to play with friends - it's challenging and requires intense group work, but it rewards its players with a unique and detailed world to discover and survive.  I also recommend original Don't Starve and of course, Shipwrecked DLC. I hope that SW will get to be integrated to Together one day, it would be cool to play in multiplayer.  Edit: Because of dedicated server hosting/configuration being such a PITA, I had to revise my review. I still love the game (and my original review above is still actual), but it is nonsense that I need to have programmer skills and multiple hours to get a goddamn dedicated server working. There are multiple guides online, but there are issues with many of them, e.g. containing wrong configurations and folder paths. Took about 4 hours to figure out how this works, with server mods, working configs and all the stuff. Server logs are too verbose and it's hard to find the errors in them, and it also sucks having to edit LUA scripts to configure them, and function calls to trigger any special commands. Take an example of Terraria, it's super simple to start a dedicated server there, even with mods (and world save is also only a single file).

76561198049112593,"Definitely a game to buy if you have friends to play with. It even comes with a copy to give to them!

There is also the incentive to play every week in the form of skins you can earn to customize characters. It's challenging (but not unfair) co-op that more people should get into.",True

Yeah sure, I sit there yelling at the game choosing a character for me, and only receiving that one character whom only eats meat. There has been a few runs as her where the world was generated just right for herbivores. Not carnivors. So, I end up dying... from starvation. Well, when I end up dying as Maxwell or whatever from the so called ""Darkness"" I sit back, yell at myself ""GOD DAMN IT!"" then I just sit there laughing at myself, and just continue to regenerate a new world, seeing what lies above infront of me that will lead me to my demise. To be honest, this game is really, really, really fun. Trying to rush yourself to try to get flint, food, wood, thatch and I usually just make fires, I don't craft torches... unless I really have to. Now, recently, I don't play a whole lot of games, nor do I watch a whole lot of YouTube, I spend my time on Discord, and usually when I'm waiting on one person in particular to come on, this game is really, really, really good to when it comes to burning all that free time and the waiting time. My entire experience with this game... has been fun. I still haven't seen everything at all, but, even knowing very little, and yet still have a lot of fun with this game. I have yet to play it... ""Together""... legit... but, I don't need anyone or anything to tell me, that playing this game will only increase your enjoyment with this game. Saying that my money wasn't worth it... and I'm salty I can't refund it now would be a large lie. It's far from the truth. This game is so fun, amazing, so cool to explore around in, I couldn't want to ass kiss a game as much as now. This game has been really fun, it's way worth it's price. I feel as if no money has been waisted here. And... now, I can't wait to try out Oxygen Not Included... seems like one of my favorite types of games. So, if your a massive fan of survival games like me, whom also... likes co-op, and or pvp, this game has both. It gets really stressfull, and I love it. This type of stress the game gives me, I don't mind at all. So, if anyone else who has actually has experience with writting reviews haven't conviced you, then my friend, I tell you, your gonna have one helluva time playing this game. Crap review writter that has no experience is out. Time to save money for Oxygen Not Included!   EDIT; So, bit of an edit... I've gotten to play the game with a friend and two... Multiplayer is even better than being alone. Hell, more stuff got done, but my friend... she wasn't so lucky... Since I actually just learned that when you buy one copy of the game, a second one is given to you, for FREE! So you can give the other copy to a friend and play together! Which... I just love so much. Ain't no reason to not be satisfied. Ah... she just kept dying and dying... from meteors. So, my computer is crap, I still manage to run the game at a full 60 fps, but when I enable the caverns, then It's still pretty high frame rate, need to actually check. If there is one thing I can complain about this... is just... how you craft. As someone who lurks in Discord chats, Having to use CAPS to pull up my crafting can screw up when I use capitals or not.(Yes, I do realize that I can rebind the key... but the CAPS key is so much better to use.) But for those who actually plans to get this, Go for it, I never really planned to get this myself. And I don't regret it one bit. So buy this game, recieve your copy, and a free copy, wait for it to be ready to trade, and give it to your friend! Oh, and also, when it comes to hosting a server, pretty easy to use, and getting your friends to join, really easy too. And since I have crap internet, my friends would connect and lag to death, but not in this game! Which.... is neat!",True

Cons  - Trolls, this is the only reason and the only thing I despise in this game, Klei this needs to stop, either ensure that these trolls can get banned or at least let us vote kick early...

It seems to be inspired by the works of 20th century philosophers from Immanuel Levinas to (ironically) Karl Schmidt where (putting this in the most colloquial sense) the world is this horrible place that wants your scalp as a trophy, that wants you alive just to kill you, where humans are these horrible panicky creature with insatiable blood lust all the while the world is also trying to see that you die, preferably a horrible and painful death. Nothing is safe and there's no where to run (but home). it is only in the safety of your home where you can evolve into a better human (also as a better killer, if you wish so) with more advanced equipment, with shinier blades and otherworldly creations. At the end of the day, ""the weak should fear the strong"".

76561198078837326,"Great value for money game , tons of things to do and ultrafun to play. i ve got 70h and i keep learning new staff.  You wont regret buying it . For those still contemplating as to which should they buy between DS or DST (source:reddit) hope it helps as it helped me )  What Don't Starve (RoG) has that DST doesn't:      Has adventure mode aka story mode that reveals parts of the backstory of Don't Starve that DST doesn't have (yet).     Content is more polished.     Dragonfly as a seasonal boss that comes for you during summer.     Has access to more polished mods that some aren't ported yet to DST due to the modder's lack of free time to do so.     Fire spreads faster, way faster.     Resurrection/Touch stones needs to be activated.     No ghost phase. If you die without an activated touchstone OR without wearing a life-giving-amulet(must be worn before your hp turns to zero) OR without any Meat Effigies in the world, you die and lose that world completely.     Upon death, you get revived at the nearest Meat Effigy. If no Meat Effigies exist anymore then the game revives you at the nearest activated touchstone. The game will use up all the Meat Effigies first before using your activated touchstones.     Sleeping in a tent/fur roll/straw roll is instantaneous. The moment you use any of these during dusk or night, you always wake up in the next morning.     Willow is fully immune to fire damage.     Woodie's werebeaver form works slightly differently.     Teleportato works and teleports you to a new world and you can only bring four items with you bring your whole inventory/hotbar and a backpack with you excluding Chester.  What DST has that DS:RoG doesn't:      Ewecus and ewecus drops.     Scaled Flooring.     Booster Shots.     Increases boss and mobs health.     Moon Rocks and moon rock walls.     More frequent Suspicious Piles of Dirt than DS:RoG even if both(DST and DS:RoG) are on default preset for it.     Mushroom Spores found in the caves(to get into the cavesbeta branch for DST, follow the instructions under Join a beta server.)     Telltale Heart     Whirly Fan     Stationary Dragonfly     Batcaves found in the caves.(cavesbeta branch found above)     Combustion works differently and much slowly compared to DS:RoG.     You can chose which Meat Effigy you revive from.     Armor has less durability. ",True

76561198080167024,"I'm mainly a solo player, so I don't have much experience with the balance of having many people in one world, but the game itself is extremely well-balanced in my opinion. The more you know, the more creative you get to be with how you deal with things, but everything has a catch. Think you found a great source of food by hunting Koalefants all the time? Well, you might just run into a nasty Varg or Ewecus instead. Built your base around a bunch of Beefalo for protection? I hope you brought your Beefalo hat for disguise so they don't angrily maul you during mating season.  The only big imbalance is in the character selection. Some characters are pretty OP compared to others, so you could have a very different game experience depending who you choose and how you use them. Otherwise, you can't really get OP unless you've invested many hours and game-years into your world, and it's easy to fail like a total noob if you don't know what you should be doing, or simply lack knowledge of some readily-available solutions. But at the same time, failing can be totally hilarious and even fun. I highly recommend running around in a new world and just seeing what kind of trouble you can get yourself into.  I like to learn by looking things up, since learning the hard way is typically very time consuming (though world-rollback helps a lot) considering how vast an array of experiences and circumstances you can run into and how easy it is to completely fail without a few tidbits of knowledge. You're almost always on your toes, and every idea or option can potentially be a life-ending or life-saving one. Every second counts! However, if you learn too much the easy way, it does become a little less fun, since there is less to discover for yourself.  I also just love the art style, and there is a good amount of humor in the game with the designs of creatures, their punny names, behavior, and what each character has to say about them.

76561198148428847,Great game love the survival aspect but I do have but a few problems. There is no guide on how to play the game. (Not by community memebers) I wish the devs. would make a turtorial and hold your hand until you are ready. To reach end game or even mid game is very hard because I sometimes have no idea what to craft. I wind up only making things to protect myself against the weather but that is really it. I would really like to see Shipwrecked to be a free update and sail around with your friends which could be so much fun or even make a free update that Don't Starve doesn't even have as a DLC. Instead of doing Shipwrecked they could do a space world (I could not think of anything and I would hate for a space world). I also wish for a Player vs Player servers that are like H1Z1 King of the Kill where you have to make weapons and fight other places. Also for the character Wilson. I don't really see a huge purpuse for him besides beard hair. He does not benefit anyone but himself. I mean he only has a positive which is really good but how it only helps him is pretty useless for your friends. I would a buff (for Together only) on him or find a way he could be useful like add a item. Overrall I love this game. Every character is unique and some take longer to master but that makes the game fun. I only survived until end summer because of youtube guides. 8/10,True

76561197981780780,"You can play this game together with freinds for hours. The game is inexpensive and goes on sale on Steam from time to time at ""you just gotta buy it"" prices. Be aware Don't Starve is a single player game with lots of cool DLC.  Don't Stave Together can be played by one person but, shines as a multiplayer game.  Dont Starve Together works well on modern desktop computers. You don't need a high end gaming computer.  I purchased a number of copies of this game for friends and  family.  They don't all have pricey gaming computers.  It's very simple to host a game your friends or family can connect to and play together on a LAN / Internet.  A good internet connection is required for games you host that can be accessed via the internet. The better the computer you use to host a game the better the performance seems to be. The games you host can be limited to friends only or open to the public.  The host of the game can stop the server and launch it later and be right where you left the game.   You'll need to play the game for a while to understand how you might want to tweak in the next game you host. More flowers, no killer bees or more killer bees, longer spring time etc.  And then you might wish you could tweak things a bit more but, the settings just aren't available in the GUI.  Here's were game MODS come in.  There are some very talented people that have created and maintain MODS for the game.  The MODS can make the game even more fun by offering options you might have wanted to see in the the retail version of the game.   Don't Starve Together is definately worth a try, especially you want to play together with some friends.

Good idea to buy the regular pack, not the one that comes with the regular Don't Starve game, unless you want to play the Shipwreck DLC. The Reign of Giants DLC comes with DST and is enough for hours of fun. I do stress, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. That's why its called Don't Starve Together in case you want to know. Playing solo is sometimes alright or with random players if you get lucky and find cool poeple. A better idea is send the second copy of the game that comes with your purchase to a good friend and have fun together. The game is hard, but you learn and adapt. Don't get attached to your character because they will die. The game can be scary when you come across areas or creatures that are strange. After a while though you will come to understand the world and the starnge creatures that roam it. The music also is just amaing and can make you feel dread to a point where you just want to build a wall around yourself and cry. The game is unforgiving, but that is why it is different from survival games like Minecraft or Terraria. Minecraft is for building, Terraria is for fighting, Don't Starve Together is for survivng the horrors of the wild and  trying to get by and eventually thrive in the beautiful, but scary, landscape.

But having played the singleplayer version of the game enough and wishing and wishing for a multiplayer version so long ago I can say with certainty that DST met my expectations and will surely meet yours. I've had a lot of fun playing with friends in calls. The multiplayer of the game is well-executed, too; so many games change core features of their gameplay in order for the multiplayer to work, but thankfully, Don't Starve is not one of those such games. Put simply, if you like the singleplayer, you'll love the multiplayer.  My only real problem was finding servers other than my own to play on. Don't get me wrong, there are hundreds of servers immediately loaded up when you get ready to play, and most of them will have at least a few players. But most of those are inhabited by people who won't talk or interact with you, which kind of defeats the purpose of the multiplayer, in my opinion. I always found it more fun when I had a group that planned to play in advance.  In any case, I'd give it a 4.5/5.

76561198163629917,"SO this game literally bonds then breaks friendship, lol. This is going to be long. I warned you.  the first time I play this, I got killed by bees. I will never lay a hand on their house anymore. really. The second time, I got killed by tree guards.  ""Hey lets chop some trees--"" ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT"" ""LMAO"" ""RUN DUDE RUN FOR YOUR LIFEEEE""  We died together.  So yeah this game never fails to entertains me. Offline mode is good, but Online is better.  I bought this game based by curiousity. No friends have played this. I didnt really have any interest in survival types game. The art styles (especially those creepy cute monsters lol) really catches my interest.  I shared the link to FB. One of my friend responded and bought it too (it was on sale. We bought mega pack) We played togeteher. And laughing like crazy on the first try. And then we got serious. But ended up dying more stupidly. lol. I told about my experiences to my friends. And then one more guy bought this game. So I had two friends that play this game. Then he bought another pack for his gf. So, three friends.   I kept playing this game so my friend said ""Whats so fun about this game?"" He ended up buying the game too, lol. Amazing. Four friends. Too much fun, dude.  I recommended this to my other friend. At first she didnt take any interest. But she accepted the copy anyway. We play together. Five of us. With mic. WE LAUGHED TOGETHER LIKE IDIOT FOR 89187281798 times. She ended up enjoying this game too. I also sent the copy to my bestfriend. And ofc, SHE LIKED THIS GAME TOO LOLLL. We talked about this game so much at school that my other friend heard about it and started to asking things. He didnt look like interested at all. I asked him to buy but he said ""why should I?"" But. youknowwhat? He bought the game anyway. (Perharps he wanted to join us) Amazing. Eight friends including me. I didnt expect it at all.  FYI four of us still have a copy so it can be twelve in the future omg.   So in a nutshell, I just wanna tell you that this game is really amazing to play with your friends. (beware if you play this with your sensitive gf. you can got into fight lol)  This game also oftenly on sale, perhaps that being one factor why my friends bought the game. This game is gold. Really fresh. And unique in every way!  (By the way I recommend you the Shipwrecked DLC for offline. It's really cool!) Your money will not be wasted for this gold! The rating ""Overwhelming Positive"" isnt lying either.  12/10 would play with mic again.",True

76561198154845634,"STORY                 One of my first times playing DST with others.                                   1. Host game                                 2. Invite 3 friends                                 3. Webber-me, Wilson, Wendy, and Willow start.                                        (I'm the only who's played the game a lot)                                 4. We split up                                 5. I find a place to set up base for us all, while friends run arround asking me stupid questions.                         6. One friend makes an axe and hits a pig and getting attacked for 5 minutes yelling ""WHAT DO I DOOO!!""                                 7. They die. (Me -*facepalm* uugh.)     8. Other friend asks how to save them so I tell them about the telltale heart (warning it takes large amount of health to make).                                 9. They create it and die in the process. (Me -*facepalm* But why?? I warnned you about... Uuuugh.)                                10. I made a base with a firepit, science machine, and an icebox.                                11. I leave the base to save the ""Souls of the ignorrant"".                                12. I use the premade telltale heart to save one and craft another to save the other one.                                13. After they're ressurected I find the third and I have them all follow me back.                       14. Night comes upon the world and everyone (but me) flips. (Me - uuugh.)                                15. I barely save them.We stay put untill morning.                                16. We head back toward the base.                                17. One friend finds a tentical spike by a body.                                18. A bee attacks him and he flips (rappid tapping f to hit it).                              19. The idiot hits me several times and kills me. (Me - You idiot. WHY?!? I get you're a noob but geeze.)                                20. I tell them how to save me but they pretty much just screw off. (In my head ""screw you guys"".)                       21. I haunt science machine causing it to burst into flames. (Me - Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry guys. *Lies*)                       22. They franticly run around THROUGH THE FIRE. (I burst into tears laughing as they scream)                                23. They all die.                                24. No living humans remain in world.                                                                                                                   10/10   Would commit genocide again.

76561198053613267,"I would have to say that Don't Starve Together is a wonderful game, however it brings about some very intricate quarrels that make me still say be careful of playing a game still in it's ""Early stages"" because it's going to give you a rather difficult time. Having played the first game, and enjoying the funny commentary, the wonderful art style and the cool survival mechanics, I am excited to see what they will bring to the second game as time passes. My only problem with this game at the moment (and hope that they will get around to fixing), the rubber banding around when playing with friends.  In a unfortunate turn of events no matter whom is hosting , other players will suffer the concequence of extream lag, running in place, and of course rubber banding (bouncing from once area to another) and it makes it so difficult to play the game with others. So long as you are hosting, these problems will not come to you however your guests will not be having the greatest of times.  I understand that this game is still in beta and has much to be done so this is only until they fix the situation will I have a more updated review to rant and rave about. I would suggest catching this game on sale in order to enjoy the rather lag based concequence it provides at the current until this situation is resumed in further patches and so on. In the mean time those that can play via lan you are most likely going ot have a better time rather than two-six people just looking to have some fun on a sever together.  Anyone looking to buy this game, unless it's on sale I would not buy otherwise until so.",True

76561197994024789,"So, a few considerations. I do heavily factor in price when I play games, I also factor in multiplayer as my preferred style. I haven't played Don't Starve, only Don't Starve Together. The game is also technically Early Access. With all that said..  Holy moly. This game is great! For 14.99, I got two copies of the game, one went to my Win10 Desktop, and the second to my girl's 2009 iMac. We haven't stopped playing since, spending whatever small free time we have gaming. My friends jump in on the fun too. Considering we got two games which means to me, the price of 14.99 is equivilant to 7.99, and we've played 7 fun hours on it, it's got its money back already.  Pros: I love the graphics a ton. Its cutesy and on the unique spectrum of games. The script is entertaining, I either find myself randomly laughing, a friend, or my girlfriend randomly laughing or quoting their character. The pros and cons of each character are more entertaining than anything while simultaneously frustrating as they mean to be. It is a base building survival simulator with a lot going for it and despite the cutesy graphics, has genuine moments of OH NO. Like when I accidentally burned down my base and the entire forest in trying to fight a tree. That's right. Or when the pigs help you battle hellhounds. There's a ton going for this game and its way ahead of others in terms of simply being Early Access, to know this isn't even fully featured is exciting.  Cons: THIS IS, AT TIMES, THE DARK SOULS OF CUTESY BASE BUILDING SURVIVAL SIMULATORS. EVERYTHING CAN BE FINE FOR A FEW DAYS AND ONE FRIEND (ME) CAN RUIN ALL OF IT BY THINKING, HEY, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA, AND THEN DESTROY EVERYTHING WE SPENT OUR EFFORT WORKING ON. IT IS ABSOLUTELY PUNISHING AT RANDOM TIMES, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A CON OR IF I AM A WUSS. But really, this is the only thing that makes me slightly cringe in a negative sense. The only real con and its not even that bad of a con, outside of this, is a lack of explanation for a ton. I don't necessarily need my hand held, but in DST (not having playing DS) there isn't a tutorial or anything. There's a lot of 1. Guesswork, 2. Experienced friends explaining things, 3. Websurfing for answers. I spent last night reading how to survive winter and I haven't even experienced it yet, all ready realizing I may be screwed.",True

76561198085499730,"Hello everyone, this reveiw is not just speaking of my opinion of this game, but my mates as well!  Don't Starve is one of many of our favorite games on PC/Steam. We were having lots of fun with this game until one day: Don't Starve Together Beta confirmed everyone! As soon as the game was open to the public we received it for we already had Don't Starve. We were so happy that this happened, I didn't start playing until some of my m8's wanted to play. So I started hosting a game and we're having so much fun 7 hours into the game. We've also got mods on it to make it even beter! Since it's still in Beta it is a little buggy but we're okay with it. It took me a little while to make and account because the Email wasn't received till later the day I signed up. But we got there in the end, the mods we've downloaded helped with some issues with lag and glitches, and we also got some of our old favorites from the original Don't Starve so we're pretty happy about that.  At times can be a challenge but yet a simple game, I'm not yet used to the attack style of the game yet but I'll get there, I'm more used to first person shooters, but I'm not gonna go there.... You choose a charecter and spawn in to a brand new world, your arn't yet to know what is expected to happen, but around the 9-10th night be ready, for there is a band of wolves that will come your way!   Also to fans and friends and other people the game dosen't take that much to run, easy to handle and a great game! I will also be recording this game with some mates after some time in the near future, so be sure to check that out when I do.

76561198058940882,"Don't Starve Together, the recent co-op add-on by Tim Burt-, I mean Klei Entertainment, steps up the already exciting single player original. Even in Early Access, you can tell that the transition from SP to MP is nearly flawless. The game plays just as well, and even though things like caves and various events aren't included yet, it's just as fun.   The only downside to the game is the people who seem to take a liking to ruining your world. I.E., a person playing as Willow has to be watched carefully, lest he/she burn your berry bushes, forests and various other items down before you even notice it.  That however, brings me to my favorite part; the mods. DST has one of the most closely-knitted mod community of any game I currently own, including a mod that makes it difficult for Willow players to light things on fire. Other mods include adding additional items, characters, etc. My current favorite is ""Renewable World"", where every item in the game respawns at some point, so you never exhaust a map of it's resources. The best part is that you can set the speed at which they respawn, so you can tailor it to your own preferences. They're all genuinely exciting, and can enhance your DST experience an endless amount of times over.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who's interested in a quirky, detailed survival experience. It's most definitely a new and exciting take on one of the most popular game genres currently out there.",True

76561198261130419,"SHORT REVIEW:   This game is awesome. Worth the money. 1. It doesn't have great graphics like Ori and the Blind Forest but this graphic makes you fall deeper into the feeling of insanity and isolation. 2. It's a great with friends and you can have a lot of fun until you all die, rage quit and come back later. 3. It is very complex and you have a lot to do and even after you get bored there are mods.          LONG REVIEW:  This game is a piece of art. One of a kind. I have only played a few hours on steam BUT I have played more through some (not fancy ways) with my friends and we had a lot of fun. That is why we decided to buy it.  1. This game is made in such a way that it makes you think that you are doing great until you die in a matter of seconds by a hound attack or a disaster. Which is great and not great for a survival game. It is great because it makes you become better and better by not letting you get too far until you try many things. But it often makes you leave, to come back later better prepared. 2. It is GREAT with friends. You can have a lot of fun together if everyone knows how to play. You can explore together, fight together and die together. 3. The item system is GREAT. You get items fast and cool items are not that expensive. Also you can craft them. ( By the way I was taking about cosmetic items.) 4. This game has a GREAT community and a LOT of mods. So you will never get bored of the game. 5. The developers are very active. Coming up with a lot of new updates and ways to make you play more. 6. The game itself is very fun and challenging. It is hard but in a satisfyingly way. 7. Worth the money. You get 2 copies of the game + the Reign Of Giants DLC basically included. 8. Good combat mechanics. Not the best but you definitely have to learn how to fight each and every animal/monster. 9. A lot of tactics and strategies so you never get the same experience. 10. A bunch of characters you can choose from and customize as you like. Even more with mods. Every character has a different play style and traits so combined with 9. you basically get A LOT of ways to play the game. 11. A very interesting feeling you get when you play it.",True

76561198305706781,"The fact that it is a 2-D game, yet fun at the same time, makes it more interesting. (I'm gonna stop right there before I get sentimental and stuff) So I would highly recommend this game because of the fun and hype it creates within the player, and the combat is just very good and smooth (depending on your computer). The game doesn't take a good computer to run. A regular, $300 or higher computer would be able to run it on its own. I do not have Don't Starve, the original, but just going to say, if I ever play it, that I will definitely have fun with it. (Also I like to have fun with the console commands, which makes it more fun, because you can spawn in SOME things from Don't Starve, even though it doesn't occur naturally inside the ""Together"" version of it.",True

Now don't f up the following, and down try to substitute anything. Place pork into a Dutch oven with onion and garlic, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat is cooked through, about 2 hours. Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from the chile pods. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups of water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then remove from heat to cool. Transfer the chiles and water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture, stir in salt, and set aside. Shred the cooked meat and mix in one cup of the chile sauce. Soak the corn husks in a bowl of warm water. In a large bowl, beat the lard with a tablespoon of the broth until fluffy. Combine the masa harina, baking powder and salt; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as necessary to form a spongy dough. Spread the dough out over the corn husks to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Place one tablespoon of the meat filling into the center. Fold the sides of the husks in toward the center and place in a steamer. Steam for 1 hour. Remove tamales from husks and drizzle remaining chile sauce over. Top with sour cream.

It's all the unexpected challenges that make this game so fantastic.  You thought you'd make a living farming all that beefalo poop to fertilize your gardens? WELP they just killed you in their rampage when you got too close to them at the wrong time of the year. Thought you'd skirt the hounds to the big mean boss in the area full of lava and collect whatever they drop afterwards? Nice, the boss just killed you. Did you just get your camp all geared up for winter? Oops, there's the lightning and it just lit your whole camp in fire, destroying everything in its wake. Did one of your group members make a hunting camp near a well stocked area full of everything you could hope for to collect? Welp, they didn't think to mention the spiders roaming nearby.  All the while the group of friends you are playing with are laughing at your misfortune.  But despite all of the setbacks that send you scurrying back to the beginning before crushing you as the winter comes rolling around - or perhaps because of them - there's just something about this game that pulls you so deep within it that it is nearly impossible to stop, until you and the group of friends you're playing with are so tired you all have trouble keeping your eyes open and you realise it's 3am and you all should be asleep.",True

76561198066939942,"[h1]Backstory of How I Got Into Don't Starve ([u][b]Skip to Next Header To Read Review[/b][/u])[/h1]   Don't Starve was a game that I bought on my birthday back in 2013. I had no idea what to expect from it when I bought it. When I eventually played it I found that I loved the mechanics, the gameplay and the artstyle. Everything about Don't Starve was great!  Then came along the first DLC for the game, Reign of Giants. It was a great addition to the game (even if I was scared to play it due to all of the new bosses.   After Reign of Giants came out I thought to myself, ""Hey, this would be great with multiplayer"". I hoped and prayed that multiplayer would be added to one of my all time favorite games for many months, but on the inside I knew that it never would come out.  When I heard that it did I lit up, I signed up for the beta and watched many youtube videos on it (By the way, I never got into the beta).  The second the game dropped on steam I bought it and sent the extra copy to my friend. We played for many months but eventually stopped playing after we lost a good world. Recently I picked up the game again and my friends and I have been having a blast!  [h1]Review of Don't Starve Together[/h1] [u][b]DISCLAIMER![/b] This Review Was Made On 08/18/2016[/u]  Don't Starve Together is a game all about, well, not starving together... or not buring to death during summer together... or not being eaten by a giant one-eyed bird... or not being mauled to death by a pack of ravenous hounds together... Look you get the point. It's a game all about using teamwork to survive in the evil world that Maxwell has created for Wilson in Don't Starve.  Teamwork can be very helpful but at the same time it can tear you apart. You will eventually run out of food, and when you do, you are bound to turn on your friends and blaim them for ""taking"" the food for themselves.  The gameplay of Don't Starve Together is almost exactly the same as in Don't Strave, except this time around there are new items to use that benefit your friends and yourself in the longrun.   Working as a team in the world of Don't Starve makes the game a hell of a lot easier for you, being able to have one person go out and get berries as you chop down wood greatly increases your chance of survival. The only thing wrong with working together is sharing of resources. This causes you to have to go out and get more food fast so you... Don't Starve. The only way to be sure that you don't fully run out of food is by raising the regrowth rate of plants and by raising the level of berries and carrots that will spawn.  [h1]Summary[/h1] Overall, Don't Starve is a great game for anyone who is looking for a fun yet hard survival game. It is also good for anyone who was a fan of the original Don't Starve.  One key point to note is that, you can play Don't Starve Together alone, making it almost the same as the base game.  It is also important to note that Reign of Giants is free with Don't Starve together. This doesn't mean that you will get if for Don't Starve as well, you'll still have to buy it separately. But honestly who cares, just buy Reign of Giants too. Klei is a great company that makes great games, so why not support them in any way possible.  I give Don't Starve Together a 10/10. It is a perfect game that deserves the overwhelmingly positive reviews that it is getting.  [h1][b]IMPORTANT FUTURE NOTE FOR DON'T STARVE TOGETHER![/b][/h1]  The Shipwrecked DLC that was released for Don't Starve is not currently part of Don't Starve Together but it most likely will be in the next few months (or at least by 2017 hopefully).  It is also important to note that all future DLC for Don't Starve will not be available for Don't Starve Together until months after it is released for Don't Starve. [b]So if they release a DLC for Don't Starve that adds more pets and monsters in the month of March, don't expect it to come out until around October of the same year for Don't Starve Together.[/b]",True

76561197969385956,"There are times I'm loving this game and there are times I'm groaning in boredom or frustration with this game. It takes a game or two to grasp the basics. Once you get the idea down though it's a fairly easy [strike]to play[/strike] to know what to do.  Find food. Find rocks. Find wood. Make tools. Build a camp site.   After that?  Explore. Advance your camp site with things you find. Find or build additional methods of gathering food. Build things to defend yuorself with when fights happen.  The problem with this game mostly comes with death. When you die you turn into a ghost and watch as your body poofs into a skeleton and drops your intire inventory on the ground for you to fetch when you return alive. The long trip back to the spawn tends to be the largest issue for me. If you went miles out to explore new area you have to walk - as a ghost - miles back to the spawn where you started the game. There you resurect in a new body, and then you walk miles back to the place you died and collect your old inventory - stopping for nights of course since travel during night kills you (again). And then miles back to get home again - with night as downtime again. Death is [b]expensive[/b] in terms of time.  If you happened to die in Winter you'll never make it back to camp since you don't come back to life with a thermal stone (an item that keeps you from freezing to death during Winter). And you can't make a thermal stone on the spot. You need ingredients for it. Which you don't start with. you have no time to get these ingredients either since you start freezing only five steps into the cold. Unless you built your camp right at the spawn or you had the foresight to set up a stone-liked campfire and some wood (and possibly a thermal stone) at the spawn you're likely perminantly dead if you die in Winter.  Death is unforgiving as well. each time you die your max HP lowers. Why they thoguht that was a good idea baffles me. If you couldn't survive with 150 HP you know you won't survive with a max HP of 30 (about 2 hits if you wear armor). This isn't unfixable. You can craft booster shots that refill the max little by little. But you have to get the ingredients for these from monsters which have a possibility of lowering your max HP further.  But I have a theory that making death so harsh makes you as a player strongly favor survival over taking a chance. And it brings players to strongly desire working as a team over being greedy by knowing you'll need the help of others to safely build booster shots and help when death becomes imminent. I won't lie though; the times I have to spend 11 minutes over a corpse run are times I start thinking it'd be more fun to play something else.  The best part of the game is when you start putting together a pretty awesome camp. The feeling of accomplishment is powerful. Having nearby allies against attacks, a reliable food source, a stockpile of tools and replacements, and pure desire to see what else is out there with your friend(s).  The art style of the game originally threw me. I probably would have tried it sooner than I did if it didn't have the clunky paper drawing look. But after actually trying the game it struck me kinda cute and quirky. the characters to choose from leave me wondering if they were programmed correctly though. One says they're comfortable in darkness but their sainity drops like any of the others does soon as night time pops.  I can't help but feel the downsides of this game will be fixed up in time. It's early access after all.",True

But they thought I was crazy and said no one wants to play a game like that, sounds like too much work. Wrong they were! (Channeled a bit of Yoda there)   It's in my top 5 favorite games of all time. It's on an even more elite list of mine. I've purchased this game, no less than 6 times (possibly more). I bought Don't Starve for both my PC and my iPad (sometimes you're stuck somewhere you don't want to be. Nothing like pulling out your iPad at the Drs Office and playing some DS. Parents LOVE when they see me, because their kids crowd around to quietly watch...and occassional adult too). I've bought the game numerous times as gifts for other people, including my own daughter (we even did a version of Hard Knock Life (It's a Don't Starve Life) about the game. I rarely if ever buy a game more than once and for more than one console, unless I LOVE a game. I dare say I will still be playing this game when I'm a dottering old grandmother.

76561197994613719,As someone who hasn't played the single player version that much I still wholeheartedly recommend this game.   You are going to get the most out of it with at least three friends. Talking and planning is essential here – maybe you will see your buddies in a new light after a few hours of a desperate battle against the many odds the game throws against you.   Beware: human emotions tend to go haywire in dangerous situations. You'll know what I mean if you ever built – what you thought was – a reasonably stable ecosystem only to completely be bamboozled by some irresponsible action of a friend.  Life will be tough but it's addicting. Especially together!  + realistic simulation of being lost in the wildernis with your friends. (=you die) + lovely graphics + the well goes deep: there's much to explore + endless replayability + intuitive gameplay (this one's a must) + stuff gets patched and refined regularly + you can burn forests!  - main menu is a bit confusing to use with the controller - you may lose a friend or two - you can burn your camp  Nomitated this game for the “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.,True

76561198061597401,"Hiya, today im giving a review on the game, Don't Starve Together. This game has its pros and cons of course, like any other game I will honestly rate it!  Don't Starve Together is a game currently in Beta made off the game Don't Starve, you must survival the dark and twisted world. Weird giants and creatures all around, harsh weather conditions, the horrid wave of hounds you always forget about until you see the words, ""The hounds are baying!"" This game is definitly a game you want to try with friends or maybe on your own, you work together or not, and attempt survival. It is difficult at first to be honest, but as the game goes on it gets alot better :)  Pros~ Character Variety(Workshop Aswell) Art style Voices are instruments Never ending Laughs and scares for all X3 A fun coop game  Cons~ Can be very difficult at times Hackers do exist Furries on Workshop Everything will kill  To sum up the game, I'd give it a 9/10, I play it with my friend Tori all the time and it's always fun, never ever do we get tired of playing it. We suck so we usually cheat. I don't like the hounds but you can turn them off, now they have gifts :D And the game gets better and better after each update :)  Buy it even if it isn't on sale, I bought the 4 pack and gave some to friends to play. You won't regret this purchase at all :)",True

76561198037044417,"A little weird to me that you either wait for the launch of this game to get don't starve together, or get a free copy of it at launch when you own the game. These games typically are a bit weird because you never get an unfinished copy of it until it's done. However it is a quirky little fun game that's 2D. Typical old school point and click type game for movement where you point and click on floor. Movement is a weird because of the graphics and the character gets stuck or has problems moving around things at times in order to pick things up. Could use more work. The devs actually put out updates and fix things. They have been timely with caring and tending for their game. This is your typical survival game. You can actually beat it in adventure mode but it is very short and not much gameplay is offered there.   You can build but it is very limitted. No roof's or shelters for you either. You can make things like umbrellas but you will never have true shelter other than building a fence. The fences are not durable and there are no gates available. It's a chore constantly breaking things to get in and out of your fenced area. Storage isn't good. Crafting storage takes a lot of wood and offers very little space. You end up crafting 30 or more just to keep your things stored. You can't really build too much and you can't rely on farming because in the winter nothing grows. You can survive from animals you hunt or stored rabits as well as other things here and there like birds. Provided, that you prepared and stocked up on items to survive. The game offers seasons which may or may not make things a tad more difficult due to weather changing.   Food will spoil quickly even in a craftable ice box. I suggest storing rabits with traps you made to catch them in storage chests so you can avoid the spoiling of food through the winter. Each storage chest can hold up to only 9 items. The idea is get what you can and survive while preparing for winter. Collect and gather resources and craft items to survive or play adventure mode and survive. At night if no light is made by you, you will die and just about anything else can kill you as well. Fun for a few hours but not enough to keep you busy for months. I pop in and out of it as new things become available.   Several mods for this edition of the game as well as the original version of the game. Recommended for short gaming sessions for those who want a much easier and funnier survival game. There are ways to avoid death by crafting armor or touching a touching stone or getting supplies to make magic items non stop that can aid you to stay alive. But if not prepapered you will die and have to restart your game again as there is perma death. However in this version of the game you can come back to life if you have your settings set for that.   This version is almost the same as the original version of the game but allows for playing with other people you pick or with randoms. You can very easily play with other people with little to no hassle or set up on your end. You do not need to deal with port forwarding settings which makes this co-op experience more attractive to newbies. Their wiki for the game is a bit weird to use and no search bar is even provided so I suggest just reading forums or talking with their community for help or ideas. Although it is not really needed as they game shows you what you can and can not craft. Making it so much easier rather than playing a survival game where you have to be glued to a wiki page because the game failed at teaching you anything or showing you what you could and couldn't do. I am really liking the games that clearly show you what is going on and what you can make. Enjoy! :)",True

DST is an unforgivable and tense co-op (optional) survival game with a Gothic/Tim Burton-esque inspired aesthetic. DST forces the player to learn through trial and error in order to not only sustain themselves but progress as well. While the game's survival, exploration, and crafting can become repetitive over time, the reward is in learning how to get further each time you play and discovering new things like items and creatures specific to their respective season and/or biome. The unfortunate downside to the lack of reward system other than experiencing the in-game world is that you will eventually see everything—and when you do, there is nothing else to get excited about.

76561198006384532,"This is a tough call as you'll definitely get your money worth in hours of gameplay and the game is fun until you realize that it's just a game of spinning plates.  As much as you want to be able to explore and do your own thing each day in game you find that you are in essense just ruled by the clock. There is always stuff that has to be done each day and there simply isn't enough time to get it all done even with extra people helping. There is a constant pressure of everything being required to prevent death.  - Need wood constantly because if you are in darkness at night you die. But of course you can't just go out and chop wood all day cause it pisses off the tree guardian then you've gotta spend a bunch of time dealing with that guy. - Need to gather or work on growing/cooking food because without food you'll die and pretty fast. And you've got to cook the food or you get nearly nothing for sustanance from eating it. - Need to search for other resources constantly to build weapons and gear that help ease the burden of your daily tasks. And protect yourself from the elements. Also your tools break so fast that 30% of what you gather goes towards the cost of crafting the items you need for gathering. - Need a stock of weapons and armor (which wear out really fast) because every few days the hounds attack or some other monster. - Have to go out and keep the local spider nests oppressed regularly because if you don't a spider queen will spawn and basically just kill you with ease then next time you try to go get some webs. - Need to also gather matierals for warm clothes and a stock pile of food in time for winter because you can't venture out too far or you will freeze to death unless you have warm cloths or warm rocks (that need to be recharged and replaced regularly). - Need to constantly monitor your sanity. Can't explore too much or see too much action in a short time and you have to sleep enough each day because if you don't you go insane. The only cure is taking a bunch of time to pick flowers, find and eat mushrooms...etc essentially wasting a bunch of time that you don't have cause winter is coming FAST!  ...and the list goes on. You are constantly under the gun of having to get 24 hours of crap done in 12 and just when you think you're ahead the game throws you a curve ball that completely ruins ya. After a while it just started feeling like work to me and the game was stressing me out more than it was entertaining me.  Yes there are lots of mods that allow you to control these aspects but I find that you really need to spend some time finding a good balance because when you stop all the need for the plate spinning you realize how dull the game actually is. The constant plate spinning distracts you from realizing there really isn't anything all that engaging on fun going on in the game - there's no story line or end game and once you've gone through the whole cycle of a year and explored the varied biomes there really isn't anything new to see.",False

Make sure to cut the trees with two branches at the top. -Be careful on what character you choose as they all have flaws but the best to start with is Wilson. -Always have some extra food on you. You'll never know when someone desperatly needs food. -Green Mushrooms are very good if you are low on sanity. Make sure too cook them though! -The best area to put a base in is near Beefalo  and a road for quick travel. -You do not have to fight spiders to get their silk/glands. Simply lure them into a trap and you get the resources trouble free! -Another say way of getting meat is by going near Moles, putting rocks/flint on the floor and waiting til they go out. Then attack them and you get a morsel without risk! -Treeguards can be be calmed by planting saplings of their trees near them. -Be careful when choosing Webber, as pigs will attack you on sight and you have lower sanity.

I'm so in love with this game, I can play it for 6-10 hours straight if time permits.  I would definitely deem this game as hard, seeing as everything's purpose in the world is to kill you. However, once you survive 5-10 days, and get the basics down, it sucks you in.",True

76561198001779896,"I described the original [i]Don't Starve[/i] as ""[i]The Sims[/i] meets [i]Castaway[/i], in the most flattering way possible."" I never would've imagined its [i]Minecraft[/i]-like survival mechanics could actually improve with friends and family. [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] proves it does.  My wife and I were both big [i]Don't Starve[/i] fans by ourselves and [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] gave us the chance to thrive or die as one couple against the world. Like a real marriage, but with lots of weird, moody pets and no life insurance. It was love at first sight and our favorite multiplayer experience so far.  It includes all of the original game's DLC (except [i]Shipwrecked[/i], but similar seafaring mechanics have been implemented recently). That means all the crafting, the fighting and the conflict is here, only now it's a shared experience. Play with friends in your local network or against Steam members from all over the world. If you want, you can still play alone as well, but why would you? Seasonal and special events like [i]The Forge[/i] and [i]The Gorge[/i] are better enjoyed with people you know. It's also great to see what combination of characters you and your friends will pick to play together. Who will go for the legacy group (Wilson, Willow, Maxwell...) and who will pick one of the newbies (Wortox, Wormwood, Wurt...)?  While Klei didn't get around to making achievements for it, which I would've liked, they've managed to get me addicted with the game's skin drops. Collecting clothes, trading them, weaving them from discarded items and personalizing my character suddenly became just as important as keeping it alive.  Need another reason to play [i]Don't Starve Together[/i]? When you buy one, you get a free copy for a friend! Even better, if you owned the original before [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] was released, like I did, you may already own it for free!

76561198042765226,"The following is just a quick overview of the game for a full review check out my website at http://ausiejamster.wix.com/ausiesgamingzone#!dont-starve-together/ccpz  Don't Starve Together is a Co-Op/PvP survival game with the ability to be online or off. It is a multi-player remake of the original 'Don't Starve' game. Featuring most of the original content and characters, yet it doesn't include caves as well as the Reign of Giants downloadable content that the original 'Don't Starve' offers. Don't Starve Together is exclusive available on PC and purchasable from the steam store. I think the game's graphics are very good, I love the art-style and the polished content. The audio soundtracks are pretty decent, but aren't really to my style, although, it does suit the art-style of the game. The SFX, however, are amazing for the art-style, showing game designers that reaching out of the main stream sounds can still set a pretty decent scene, while adding to the player experience. It doesn't really have a story, however, you can easily extend the story from the original 'Don't Starve' Game. The game's content however doesn't have a massive downfall because of the lack of story as Klei Entertainment continuously update the game showing they do really care about it. The controls are pretty straight forward and decent with enough buttons to do what you want to do without having to try too hard, making the game easy to pick up. The difficulty of the game, I think is very solid not to hard but also not to easy, giving the game a lot of play time. There is some strategy to the game allowing the player to select the way they would like to produce their living essentials and whether it is stable in all seasons. There is no competitive side on this game at the moment, although, this might change in the future as Klei Entertainment is playing around with the PvP content. Overall I would give the game a score of 8.5/10 I do really think this game can have a lot of success in the future (as it is still in early access).",True

With this, now you can laugh, cry, and otherwise have a few buddies experience the same things you do.  That being said, I'm using my previous review:  ---  Don't Starve and Dwarf Fortress share one thing in common; losing is fun!  The game itself is a huge learning experience, and you'll always get further (usually) the last time than you did the first time.  Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.

76561198016539117,"A fantastic game !  It actually took me some time to give this game a shot until i saw it being for sale and so i took my chance. Seriously i dont even regret that decision at all , besides some ""small"" things more for that later.  The artstyle is fantastic and i like those creatures and giants or those characters you can play,each with their own pro and cons and different stats.  Your main goal is to survive as long as possible and trying to get rid of those constant threats ,which are seasons ,giants or invasions and trying to avoid starvation or becoming insane,which can be sometimes really challenging ,but to make it even more challenging there are also players ,that tends to griefing by lighting your base on fire ,destroying stuff in there or just stand at base (,which you build to have an easier time or you play nomad style )and keep eating off your supply and ressources off in no time and trust me a lot of people do that and if you dont have people, that do stuff to surive together you find yourself rather being frustrated and annoyed from the game.  Actually there are people ,that complains that the community is toxic and ,if someone get seens/called griefing/griefer.He gets kicked rather quick from the server ,which some trolls tends to abuse.The big problem in this game are those people you play on random servers,which can make all your effort useless ,but i also gotta say ,that you barely get any information about what to cook or not ? for example. You can make crockpots to cook food. Sounds simple right ? Yes it is , if you know the proper recipes.You can get with 4 ingredints quite a lot of different foods,if you missplaced them or took too many of another one.So if you dont spent time on wiki or finding people ,that help you through the game.You might find yourself frustrated and hating on this game and may gonna say it's the worst game you ever bought for that price.  Still for that you can play with friends together and try to learn the game together ,which is a lot of fun and in general i recommend doing so to avoid randoms people,since 80% of them are trolls/griefer/eater aka just staying at base and eating everything ,thats in the fridge just like in real life :^)   However i still gonna recommend this game.Just because it's an amazing survival game with interesting ideas for characters and mechanics and lots of hidden secrets and quite a lot of stuff to discover or to learn,but there is one more thing ,that i might want to add.  This game has mod support ,which adds new characters into the game with their own functionality and QoL changes or more content in general.",True

76561198272707439,"Oh boy, another survival game for me to boot.  This game won't hold your hand for every little things that you do. You're basically free to do whatever you want! That doesn't mean you're up for a good time, though.  Being free to do everything doesn't mean you're allowed to do everything. Especially those who don't wanna learn how to stay alive in the game.  Unless you poured some hours onto the game, expect a non-forgiving survival, an uncompromising adventure of being stranded somewhere and forced to survive, gather resources, stave off hunger, and last but not least, hug the comforting fire pit that soothe your dreary night ahead while slowly losing your sanity.  IF, and IF, you're a survivalist type, this game is not too different from your usual cup of joe. I've played some harder survival game than this, but this game is definitely a start for newcomers, if they wanna learn the hardship of survival game while playing with different characters of one and another.  Main Wickerbottom? Immediate crafting for your former days and books usage for the latter. Main Wendy? Weak in term of hand-to-hand fighting, but a go-to if you want a friendly ghost that do stuff for you. Main Wigfrid? Those mobs won't stand a chance against your valkyrie might... but you despise veggies on your diet.  There are couple of ways to survive, and that is if you're playing alone.  It's called ""Don't Starve TOGETHER"", by the way. You're not alone, if multiplayer session is your choice. People across the world, or across your sofa, will be pitted in the same land to survive. Will you cooperate together and face the darkness, or, instead of trusting them of your well-being, you annihilate them, crush them like a bug, and force them outta the server because you're too good at fighting? There are times when you just wanna login and hangout, chat a bit, play it smooth and not to worry with dying, and luckily the game provides you with that as well, phew. What was that? I hear you just wanna watch the world burn thanks to your torch? Suit yourself in 'Madness' section and wreck havoc for your silly little enjoyment.

76561197998594788,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly hard but fun rogue-like multiplayer game where teamwork means everything to one's survival. Taken straight from Edgar Allen Poe's fever dreams, a scientist named Wilson follows instructions given by a mysterious voice out of his radio. After having built a mysterious machine, he powers it on and it warps him to a world unknown to him. Wilson and his friends encounters many dangers in the wild as they try to find their way back home. And this time you get to enjoy the adventures online.  One thing you should know about this game is you're going to die. A LOT. Every time you die however, you'll have learned something new and you're going to come up with a new strategy to beat the game. But every time you think you've got it this time, you'll encounter new dangers and it's back to the drawing board. Don't Starve will not sit you down to read the instructions and expects you to find out what to do on your own. This steep learning curve provided me with many trips to the Don't Starve wiki. From playing with friends however, I also found value in the Steam Workshop, which comes with many fun custom characters to play, useful tools and game hacks to make the game a little less perilous. It should be said that I have never beaten the game before and it's so hard I've not even bothered with the DLC yet but it's still one of my favorite games on Steam. Definitely give it a try!",True

Also (my friends disagree but) getting insane is probably not the best idea, in this game or otherwise.   It's really addictive gameplay that easily brings back your adventurous spirit as you navigate and explore the world around you - a world all to yourself, free for you to do whatever you want with it, provided that you stay alive.

76561198006268747,"The original Don't Starve game was a quirky and charming little game, that while a bit rough (hard and unforgiving to a point), I grew to love as I played. I'm happy to say that Don't Starve Together is more of the same exciting fun, but with friends. The game contains some new content only found in it, such as new boss creatures, and provides a different kind of fun with friends in tow. I highly recommend this game, even if you have no one to play with, but is a sure fire buy if you know someone on your list who already has it.",True
76561198287053948,"A new world, a new adventure.  I love the dark aesthetic and the creativity that's put in each character. Each character has a different play-style, and it feels like playing a whole different game whenever you pick a different character: it makes it refreshing and very replayable. There's also quite a number of synergies between characters, and different strategies can be employed depending on which characters are available. Due to the nature of some harder creatures in the game, it is highly recommended to play with more players. Solo-playing can be fun and challenging, but it gets stale over time.  The most fun I have playing this game is with friends. Each new world feels like a rush, and each player has a significant role in the very critical stages of the early game. Teamwork is the key to survival. It's definitely a game made to be played with friends.",True
76561198155889527,"Really fun game, if you enjoy minecraft you are likely to enjoy this. However, less repetitive than minecraft, overall more challenging, each season brings a new challenge to overcome. One problem though is once you are fully loaded, the survival portion is pretty much taken out of the game, you no longer worry about dying. Still very fun to play with friends, and playing with strangers can add a lot of competition.",True

76561198061989281,"[h1]Positives[/h1] [list] [*] Sandbox playstyle [*] Unique characters [*] Great art style [*] Never a dull moment [*] Free content and updates [/list]  [h1]Negative[/h1] [list] [*] Steep learning curve [/list]  TLDR; [strike]Don't Starve Together (DST) is a great game to feel like you are in control of your own life.[/strike] (I'm joking!) DST is great for people who wants to co-operate with others to learn how to overcome an environment that is out to get you. It is both a co-operative game and a man vs system game.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [u]Sandbox playstyle[/u] DST is like minecraft, where there are many things to do. Harvesting, fighting, exploring, maintaining a base, etc etc. It is a game that allows the player to form their own goals/tasks. It is easy to get immersed in the world and lose many hours in one session of playing.   Despite playing 40+ hours, I still feel as if that I have not seen half of what the game has to offer!  [u]Unique characters[/u] It is rare these days, to have characters that are uniquely different from each other. (That being said, the game isn't very good at explaining the difference. It might be better to read up on what each character have to offer via the wiki.) The starting characters aren't just visual but each of them bring something different to the game and subsequently the server. Some characters excel in certain areas of the game and finding which one fits an individual playstyle is certainly a game all on its own.   Each character is also defined by an instrument and it is fun to not only see but also hear the difference!  [u]Great art style[/u] I mean, have you seen the screenshots? The characters, monsters and world is styled so differently from other games that it is easy to recognise the game through screenshots. Furthermore, the game love its puns in the name. (My personal favourite is [spoiler] Deerclops[/spoiler])   [u]Never a dull moment[/u] The game world is constantly changing. There are many things to learn and the moment you think you got the hang of it, the seasons changes, and each season brings their own troubles and benefits and everything in between.   [u]Free content and updates[/u] When I first picked up the game, I wasn't expecting that there were still future content to come. Especially when it is rare these days to not just ship them as a separate DLC. A big thank you, for the huge amount of content that we currently have and new stuff to come!  [h1]Negative[/h1] [u]Steep learning curve[/u] I only really have one, and that is the fact that it is not an easy game to introduce to new players. It is hard to balance the line between handholding and wanting to pass down important tips to a friend. I love the fact there are several ways to go about acquiring knowledge.   There is the wiki route, where even the wiki itself is massive and it is very easy to get lost in there. And that with the crafting system, there are layers to many knowledge that is offered.   There is the trial and error route, which takes more time but is very addicting. The feeling of knowing or learning something without any help is a huge morale and fun boost.   Otherwise, it is a great game to play with other clueless friends and be proud as both you and them learn the ways to navigate this world!",True

Things like longer day, more recources and of course endless mode will make it way easier for you to learn to survive in the hostile don't starve worlds. Also looking for tips on youtube and the don't starve wiki can also do you wonders.

It's tedious, frustrating and impossible for many to even survive their 1st winter.  I think that's part of what makes this game interesting. Unlike most survival games, this one is actually challenging for you to survive. In fact, it's so challenging that it can drive players to the point of delusional paranoia and boot you from servers if they convey you as trying to sabotage their current game.

I loved it as I had hoped, but ended up playing the single player version more on PS4. My friends could not always play and I really have no desire to pay for Playstation Plus. I got the mega pack around when Wortox was released and not being able to purchase and play him really killed playing Together alone for me on PS4. It took chasing the Hamlet DLC for me to purchase a bundle on Steam and I don't regret it. All the features denied to me on PS4 I finally have access to and I am loving it. Too bad none of my friends can really play with me on this version like PS4. I suppose if there is some grand conclusion from my experience, it is that it is a great game; it is just that different platforms have pros and cons for this game and if you are interested in DLC it is for the single player version. That last part is a pro or a con depending on your preference, but I tend to be a fan of DLC for games I like.

I've always wanted to play Don't Starve, and I feel that playing Together will give me the overall knowledge and skills that I will need to be successful playing on my own in the future.   This game is definitely based upon trial and error for those who don't look at online guides to be successful in games, and my only wish was there to be some sort of opening tutorial, to get first time users acquainted to the style and overall functions of the game easier.

I love the fact that this game is filled with lore behind each and every character (more for some than others), as well as the fact that each and every character feels completely unique with Willow (The Firestarter) who takes longer to overheat but is quicker to cool down and starts with a teddy and a lighter, as well as Webber (The Indigestible) who can befriend spiders and upgrade their dens. Even though this is game is called Don't Starve Together it can be played alone (as I often do so) or with friends meaning you can share this experience with your friends. If you really want to play by yourself I would recommend Don't Starve as you can get extra content and new characters from DLCs (2-6 pounds I think) such as Shipwrecked which involves your characters being shipwrecked at the start and allows from the creation of boats and new characters and bosses along with new creatures.",True

I also have had problems with the events and cosmetics system. While I like it and all, I don't like the idea of paying for things other than the base game. Events with the Forge got me upset because they were only limited time things and unfortunately they had some really cool cosmetics that were only available during the time.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] I find it best to go into the game blind and learning it all yourself [spoiler]The game is really hard by default, which is part of the fun, there is many things you need to keep track of and there is always something you need, be it something that will make surviving easier or something to fix something that has gone wrong like your food garden lighting on fire somehow. Often you need to make tough decisions like ""should I eat this meat raw and risk future starvation or risk starving now so I can cook it so it fills me up for longer?"" or ""Should I eat this to keep myself from starving at the cost of taking damage?"" or ""Should I kill this taking damage or die in the process but possibly gain some good food to keep me fed for a while?"" There are many fun and charming characters to pick from, none are better than each other but have their own advantages and disadvantages, they all have their own personality and play-styles. There are 4 seasons, each with their own challenges to overcome, freezing in the winter, insanity in the spring, overheating in the summer, and then there is autumn which is kind of your short break from the chaos to make sure you are prepared to do it all again. Your progression in the game does not come the game itself, but rather what you have learned, what to eat and what not to eat, how to make food into the best possible other food.[/spoiler]  [h1]Story[/h1] The game has a deep lore which comes after the story of ""Don't Starve"".

Playable characters have diverse mechanics that assist and support different playstyles. The humor in this game is subtle and hilarious. The game is fairly easy to mod for as well!  The music, world, and visuals tie together with a nice, neat, pretty bow. The mechanics are simple and there is no tutorial. The game itself if built to be explored and pokes and prodded at. I have logged hundreds of hours into this game and I am still learning new things!

76561198079610988,"Okay, so this game might not be for you if you're more into solid goals and objectives. Survival is a long-term objective and has way too many possibilities, you know? I tried playing this game with a bunch of first-timers and they were not having a good time. But as someone who has played the single-player mode quite a bit, HOOOO BOIII am I having a heck of a time.   You learn a lot from other players, you can fight together, and you gain a sense of companionship. What better way of feeling a sense of human connection than having someone feed you some nice warm food? I died earlier today because one of my fellow players was freezing and I tried to harvest some silk to make them a winter hat. No regrets :)  I would say the game has a bit of a learning curve since there are a lot of items that can be made. It definitely helps to have some recipes in your head especially because DST does not have a pause functionality. So this tip is for you, newbies: GO FIND SOME FLINT. - Flint + twigs = Axe -> Wood -> FIRE.  - Flint + twigs = Pickaxe -> Stone (and more flint!) -> FIRE PIT. See where I'm going with this?  Also some other principles I have in mind when I play: - If you find a road, try following it. It may not lead to anything fruitful but you gain extra movement speed on roads so might as well utilize it to explore more. - Poop is your friend. Bucket of poop is a better friend! - One of the first items you might want to try making is a garland. Watch your sanity! - Read the wiki in your free time and expand your knowledge. It will help.  Today I almost survived winter. Tomorrow I hope I can stay alive to tell the story. :P",True

I often play on endless just to revive easily and not really have to worry about consequeces (except of course when your health is capped at 25% of your original health if you don't have Booster Shots). The workshop is very interesting too, seeing as you have client side and server side mods (I personally recommend the screaming rabbits mod, it's client side and makes all of the rabbits scream like grown men).

76561198192012849,"The art style is very charming, and so is the game play and characters. Though not everything is perfectly balanced, with some things needing serious nerfs and others needing buffs, it's still a nice experience which is even better with friends. (though lets be honest, how many of us have those? ha.   ha.         yeah...)  I will be honest, the multiplayer in most steam games I've played (excluding dedicated servers) is outright @$&*. Many of the other games I play suffer unbearable lag in multiplayer. This game is not one of those. The multiplayer runs very smoothly, regardless of who you may be playing with, and regardless of if it's hosted or if it's a dedicated server. (I have a friend who lives on the other side of the world and this is the only game we can play together without lagging to death) For those of you without friends, worry not! The multiplayer is not limited to friends only. There are many public worlds that you can hop into and meet new friends in! I can't guarantee that the people you'll meet will be friendly, though. It is survival of the fittest, after all.  The world customization is one of the best I've ever seen. Slight warning though: some of the settings are touchy (setting some resources to appear more often makes them practically flood the world, and setting some to appear less might make them practically nonexistent.)  The game's server-by-server modding is a very nice feature. I don't have to enable or disable mods each time I load up a different world, and can have different configurations for each one. It doesn't have world seeds, though, so cherish any world you generate that has a great start location.  This game is by no means easy, of course. If you've played the original Don't Starve, lots of the things in the world have gotten massive health boosts, which spells out doom for people trying to play alone. If you're not too good with these levels of challenges (like me) or don't have many friends to play with (also like me until a few days ago), I'm sure the workshop has something for you.

76561198117446813,"Would Strongly Suggest!  The Dont Starve games are one of the most interesting survival games I have played. Lets start with the stats you have to maintain. Health: one of the many things that make DST difficult for new players is maintaining health, you see , you dont regain HP over time as any character. Making the only way to heal your self is with certain healing items or food. Hunger: In DST you can make a Crockpot which allows you to make all different kinds of food to help raise or even Decrease your stats. Next is the most unique and interesting stat of DST is... Sanity your right you can go insane in this game! Your Sanity decreases at night, dusk and in other scenarios! Its important to keep your Sanity levels decent or else you might be given a visit by a Shadow Creature. These Menaces are one of the only sources of Nightmare fuel a valuable and important resource, note that they aggressive but are easy to fight. Theres a Day-Night Cycle in DST aswell and during Day its normal usually but it depends on the season. In Dusk its a warning of the upcoming Night. In Night you better have a light source because it becomes pitch-black and if your caught without light the Nightmare Monster Charlie comes and if not prepared will 1 shot you. In every season is a Boss at the Beginning Middle or End. Each of the 4 bosses cannot be approached but it comes to you at the designated time. Each boss is designed to be simular to the according season. Bearger is for Autum Bearger is a Bear mixed with a Badger and will eat all of your Winter ration if not taken care of, but drops a resource unique to itself that will aid you in Winter if used right. The Deerclops is the winter boss he will usually come around the night of day 30 or 31 and will warn you of its arrival with deep breathing to warn. He will drop his eyeball that can be used for a Over-Powered hat umbrella known as the Eye-Brella. Beware of his Huge -200 Sanity per min Aura. In the Spring bosses case the Moose-Goose is optional granted that she spawns with her ducklings at certain Moose-Goose spawning locaitons. Beware of her dis-arming honk but also after death her ducklings will become hostile and attack but also granted feathers for the next seasons use.The feathers best use is for a weapon that summons tornados but also can be used to make a fan. In Summer the Antlion is your next foe. She isnt exactly necessary to fight but is a pain if not fed with trinkets and rocks or killed. If not pleased she will created sinkholes or if underground earthquakes, warned but the screen shaking. Interesting fact the Singleplayer version of DST known as just DS (Dont Starve) the original Summer boss was Antlion but she dosent come after you like the others but beware shes a raid boss which also means shes a stronger boss.  Next and last subject is The Seasons them selves an the dangers that follow. Autum: known to be a calm passing period no real dangers. Winter: Extreme cold, if not supplied with warmth, will kill you easily. Spring: known to be a harsher passing period due to the constant rain which can cause Freezing and Insanity. Summer: Extremely Hot, the heat isnt a problem alone wild fires can happen at random causing your base to engulf in flames in not prepared with a Ice-Flingomatic (Fire exstinguishing machine.)  That was a little bit Info compared to the games size (This Review dosent include Combat Methods, Charecter guides and Cave Info)  So I hope you Purchase Dont Starve Together if you can! ",True

76561198286584854,"I've played DST for a really long time, like a really REALLY long time. I have over 300 hours on it and it's probably my most played game in my entire steam inventory. That being said, this game is PHENOMENAL. The art style is to die for, the themes for when you get into boss fights, ambient music, how each character has their own instrument are incredible. There are so many little nuances that Klei inserts into the game that makes me revere it so highly, it's the small attention to detail in the game that makes it so fantastic.   This game has quite a bit of a learning curve. You'll start out, and try to survive (probably rather unsuccessfully) and learn about what different mobs do, what certain structures do, which ones to build, and so forth. The beauty in this game is within its learning curve. It's designed for you to learn from your mistakes in a comical world where at first nearly everything can kill you, it can almost be discouraging. This matters so much however once you reach the point where you can actually survive. The amount of reward you feel, the amount of work that's paid off is immense and it feels as though now that you've explored the game intimately enough you can really have some fun. Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that unlike other games where the player grinds to try to achieve something and feel successful, the fun for DST is experiencing and learning curve, as well as the payoff in the end. Even after you can survive, there's much more to do! There are boss fights and caves and the ruins, all things where the game continues to challenge the player.

Despite all that happiness, i've never play this game alone, like this game is not my type actually, but with a friend, this game could is really fun.

76561198064753584,"TL;DR review: this is a 10/10 masterpiece and sits near the top of the best all-time indie and survival genres. If you don't have the game and it is on sale, buy it. If it's not on sale, it's still underpriced, and well worth the cost. I'll continue a more detailed review below.  The outstanding singeplayer ""Don't Starve"" is strengthened even more with the addition of multiplayer, here in the ""Don't Starve Together"" variation. If I were asked to name a great game that becomes even better with friends, this would probably be my top recommendation.  As you can see from the images, the art style is rather dark, yet charming. This theme remains consistent throughout all aspects of the game, combining perfectly to impress audiences of all ages and aesthetic preferences. Despite having the semblance of a nice little relaxing game to play, the game does not hold your hand, and provides minimal guidance.  You are thrown into the wilderness with many challenges and dangers to face. Don't expect to do well without a lot of trial-and-error. And even after you've figured out how to make light and avoid dying in the darkness, how to hunt, gather, farm, and cook enough food to maintain your hunger for a little while longer, the game will throw new challenges in your face that you probably will not be ready for.  The gameplay is deceptively simple -- gather supplies, build structures, craft equipment, flee from or fight monsters, and ultimately, survive. This pairs perfectly with the game's unique form of difficulty. The game does not seem so difficult until a new problem appears and you have to figure out how to solve it. When faced with that problem, your survival will be determined by a few principles: having enough knowledge of the game to deal with the problem effectively, anticipating and preparing for this problem, and either being creative enough or improvising to solve this problem. To a lesser extent, the game does have a small mechanical skillgap, but the mechanics are simple for the most part. The only real mechanical challenge will be learning how monsters move and determining when to attack, dodge, and run from them.  Ultimately, the game will push both your character and you to your limits. Even when you get lucky, you'll probably still face an exhilirating near-death experience. Otherwise you'll die and learn new things about the game, and be better prepared to face that challenge in the future.   Don't Starve is on par with a small list of masterpiece games that beat you down for your mistakes without making it feel like the game cheated you. Each mistake being preventable, your blunders truly feel like opportunities to learn how to build yourself back up later on.",True

This is an extremely diffficult strategy game. It's fun as a kind of game when you want to see ""How many times can my buddies and I fuck this up before we get bored?"" but is also entertaining as a pretty serious strategy game you spend hours forming. Ride or die, man. You'd think three hours is enough time to get a handle and start playing seriously and lasting for seasons at a time. My girlfriend and I still die within three days.

76561198127693034,"This game is definitely not easy, it'll be difficult to learn and master to kite and kill enemies. Be prepared to die a lot at the beginning, you can rollback your world 1 day if you're playing alone to prevent resetting your world or use commands.  There is 4 seasons with their own unique bosses with powerful and interesting boss specific drops. There is also raid bosses that are very difficult, they can be killed alone but will be extremely difficult at the beginning. Each session also has it's own challenges, such as overheating during summer, frog rain in spring, freezing during winter, etc. which requires you to acquire particular items in order to survive.  The gardening system (farms) are useful to have in order to grow crops which you'll require for unique dishes made using the crock pot (Don't use the basic farm, use the advanced one). crops such as the dragon fruit can be used to make one of the best source of healing in the game, but retrieving the crop you want is difficult as the fruit/veg that appears will be random and certain fruit/veg have a higher chance to appear compared to other ones making it difficult to retrieve certain fruits and vegetables you want. Once you retrieve the crop you want, I'd recommend feeding it to the bird in the cage to get that fruit/vegs seeds in order to grow it.   The combat system will be difficult to master, you have to learn to kit enemies which is moving and dodging pretty much. You get great satisfaction when you learn to kill more difficult stuff.   Each season (Autumn, Spring, Spring, Summer) has it's own difficulty, Summer and Winter being the most difficult.   Each character have their own unique perks and advantages and disadvantages which change the way you would play them in comparison to the other characters, for example (one of the characters cannot sleep, two are seen as monsters meaning neutral creatures are hostile, one can only eat meat based food only, etc.) Certain characters are much more efficient at doing another characters role, I'd recommend testing each character to see which suits your play style. (I recommend Wilson during the start to learn the game, unless you looked at guides)     You can retrieve mods that improve on the UI, provide you with a mini map, display your temperature and more. There is mods that add new characters, biomes, structure and more as well. These can be used to make the game easier or more difficult. (Be aware that mods can be out of date)  Cooking foods is certainly fun, but certain foods are much more efficient at providing health, sanity and/or hunger due to the value they provide and how much more easier and efficient they are to make. Certain foods have effects such as raising your temperature. I recommend knowing different types of foods rather than learning what's the best for restoring certain stats.   There is much more to say about how great this game is.",True

The game itself is more enjoyable with a friend, but this doesn't stop you from enjoying it on your own. Working together as a team is a good thing in this game, and each season brings on new challenges and creatures, so you're always on the go strategising your next move! It's always been fun to talk about the equipment you may need or where a good position to set up camp is. Coming back to the single player aspect, You can play on your own in Don't Starve Together, just as you can in Don't Starve, and I made the misake of purchasing Don't Starve before Don't Starve Together, thinking they were essentually two different offers. They're not, so I would also recommend not purchacing Don't Starve as there's no real point.

Surviving with other players is both fun and rewarding with all the shenanigans that you and your team will get into. Don't Starve Together has loot drops that you can earn or buy. All of them are just skins for exisitng items and characters and does not offer any advantage in-game wether you buy them or not. If you are new to the game, I suggest having a wikia open to help you with the crafting of items in the beginning of the game. The community is very helpful if you ever need help with what you need to do to survive and progess.  Don't Starve Together is a great game with a great art style and a rewarding progression system.

76561198066917925,"I have been aware of the Don't Starve series since its original release, yet I had never given any of the games a try until just this last month. The survival-crafting genre is probably one of my least favourite, though I have an extensive library of games related to it, but Don't Starve is one of the few I have played that genuinely gave me the ""just one more day/night"" mentality, something that I can't remember any other game of the genre doing for me. It has such a unique set of charming art, intuitive mechanics, challenging gameplay, and captivating air of discovery that make it an essential title to play. The multiplayer aspect of Don't Starve Together / The Forge only further extends the enjoyment and replayability of this game, as you get to share in the struggle and misery of the Don't Starve world with someone else, making for plenty of shenanigans. This game really was a pleasant surprise for me, and though it is an older series now it remains a refreshing experience even in 2018.

76561198249827228,"Bringing multiplayer to my all-time favourite survival game was one of the best ideas Klei ever had (besides making the original game in the first place). It retains the wonderfully weird, oddly bleak feel of the original game and slams it in with a bulk of new content and the ability to invite your friends to starve with you. And then you play as Willow and burn everything they make, because that's what multiplayer survival is all about: betrayal. At least, it is for me. But I'm getting off track. The point is that this game is the greatest multiplayer survival game I've ever played.  Music: 89% -- Some of the best, most unique music in a video game. Graphics: 92% -- A unique, unforgetable art style that is brilliantly drawn. Gameplay: 85% -- Excellent gameplay with great mechanics. Like insanity. And starving. Story: 73% -- The world of DST, like the original game, has some of the weirdest, most interesting lore I've seen. Difficulty: 80% -- I didn't rate it on balancing this time, because Don't Starve is meant to be hard, and this is. Enjoyment Factor: 92% -- Oh, it's so fun.

76561198122155280,"Don't Starve Together is an even harsher environment than single player Don't Starve, but when you finally get people to play with you it's extremely rewarding. I've been putting it off for years from owning it because I couldn't get anyone to play with me, but it turns out the community is for the most part welcoming and friendly if you just hop in.

The art style is a nice twist in my opinion and i personally like it. if you dont then thats just your preference. The game its self is solid. you'll enjoy not knowing how to build anything and no tutorial or tips or what your even doing. its all a big learning experience by trial and error. which adds to the fun of the game and makes you feel accomplished when you figure things out. The crafting system is actually well done. though youre not told what does what the crafting is solid. every craftable item tells you exactly what items it takes to craft the item you want its just a matter of finding where and how to get the material needed.   The bad thing about dont starve together ive found is the community unfortunately. a lot of people are picky. if you set certain settings in your world and make some freinds while playing and they dont like it, theyll most likely get mad at you, tell you your trash and then unfriend you on steam. Most of the community hve been playing this game for some time and are not noob friendly people. I would reccomend making your own private server first and learning the ropes then after you learn some things make a public server or hop into one and lthen ask for tips from people. if you go into it knowing nothing people will get very mad.   other than that the game is great. for what it is id give it a 9 out of 10. its a definite buy if you like this style of game.",True

76561198388604192,"Bought this game to play with my brother thinking it would be a good deal but found it was an amazing deal when i realised you didnt need to buy two copies as it gave you a second one anyway.  On a laptop (not a high end gaming one) it didnt respond for a couple of minutes when loading the game, joining a game, or hosting a game. But, once it was loaded the game played flawlessly. Even on bad wifi, you can still play offline by playing LAN if you wish to play with others or if you want to play alone you could play in the middle of the sahara dessert if you wished.  The game does not push microtransactions upon the player, and microtransactions wont give players unfair advantages as they are purely cosmetic as far as i can tell.  Overall i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing on public servers but i would really suggest gifting the second copy to someone you think would be interested because while it is more than entertaining playing online it is ten times better with friends.",True

76561198059389066,"[Introduction] Don't starve together (And Don't Starve) is hands down, one of the best games I have played. I've been with Don't starve since the beginning with early access, it was the second game I bought on steam so I've always loved this game. But this game is 100% worth 15$ it's fun with friend, or without. I do recomend going into this game blind, maybe watch a video that lets you understand some of the mechanics but try to go in unspoiled.  [Gameplay Overview] Don't Starve Together is a permadeath multiplayer game that has you balance between health, hunger, and sanity and trying to survive as long as possible aswell as acheiving goals. The gameplay is fun and challenging as you have to learn everything from experience, I remeber the first time playing don't starve game and knowing nothing about it, from the first [spoiler] hound attack,[/spoiler] all the way to fighting [spoiler]deerclops[/spoiler] it was horrifying but I learned from those expeirences and learned how to deal with them, this has been improved on in Don't Starve together as you can experience the game with friends! If you find the game too hard you can increase the ammount of food and resources and decrease the ammount of enemies as the world is fully customisable, you can increase the ammount of enemies to lots, or make the world always dark.   [Art Style] The art-style is one of the best I've ever seen, it captures the mood of the game so well and is beautifully animated serious props to Klei as the art-style is what seperates this game from all those other early access survival games.  [Pros] -This game has a great art style, and overhaul theme to it. As you slowly go insane you seen halucinations, hear voice, and slowly watch the world distort as you are plunged into darkness -The game is hard, which I like hard, I like a challenge other people may not like this but I personally love a challenge   [Cons] -Game can get boring without friends, but really depends on the person -Game can get repetitive after you play it for long periods of time   [Final Thoughts] This game has a tone of replayability as there is lots to explore, and even a workshop that has tons of content that includes character mods, new weapons, and even DLC's that have been ported from Don't Starve Standalone. I've gotten over 250 hours of enjoyment fo $15 I'd says a solid 10/10",True

It's decently cheap and you can get a lot out of it from how many mods and addons there are for it. Personally, I think that they should've included multiplayer options in Don't Starve itself rather than making this a separate game, strange choice honestly, but they're both great! I personally think multiplayer is more fun since you get to dick around with your friends and you don't get that hollow loneliness as you look at your reflection in the black loading screens.",True

And you will - game is constantly getting polished, new events take place and it's usually fun. Usually, because X attempt at getting through X season might be getting... Perhaps not boring, but a little bit tiring? I would also recommend playing with more, than 2 people, the more the merrier and easier in general sense.

Since I didn't have a steam account at that time, I purchased it on my brothers account. Once Klei released Dont starve together, I was hooked. It is updated a good amount of times a year, and has a unique artstyle I love. Dont Starve Together is a amazing survival game to play with your friends, and even supports mods to create your own experience. It has events every once in a while, to add some spice to the play style of the game. Even if you dont want to play co-op, there are many different options to change how you play including pvp to allow a more competitive playstyle. Dont Starve and Dont Starve together are an experience that I beleive most people would enjoy, and ever since Dont Starve Together was released in 2016, I am stilled not bored of it, and play it with all my friends.

It's charming with the graphics and the sounds and while this game dumps you in with no assistance, at least if you have a friend that can help, it makes the experience hillarious as you are dying and this person is helping you get revived, while you can still assist as a ghost. I would like more like a index to learn about this game more, but it's indicative of any survial game.

This game might looks simple, yet it requires you to learn and search for guides to actually live through the hardship which is why I suggest the game.",True
76561198031673076,"Compared to the regular Don't Starve the multiplayer version delivers a more challenging experience. Everyone needs to gather way more resources, communicate with each other and team up to withstand dangerous situations. A larger group has a better chance in defeating monsters but in the same time requires a lot more food to survive which balances the gameplay pretty well. All the characters have unique characteristics which can deliver huge benefits for the team or set them up for more trouble. For example Webbers spider nest can be a good source of silk and meat but after a few cycles there is a chance that it will spawn the Spider Queen. Everyone also gets a penalty in the form of a constant sanity drain if a member of the group died and is floating around as a ghost. The playerbase is usually friendly but if you join a server that is about to hit the winter season you will come across the rule of limited trust and might not get directions to the main base. This might sound a bit hostile but is just a little insurance against people who jump into a server and decide to destroy everything you and your team worked hard on. The best thing you can do is to gather some experience in single player, send the extra copy of Don't Starve Together to one of your Steam friends and jump with him / her into a private server. This way you will avoid trolls and in the same time learn about the new content that wasn't available in the classic game.",True

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign her",True

When you start, you want to know it all, and when you do, there is some event or update, so this adventure never ends. A wonderful world that does not burden you with quests, just an endless cycle of creating and exploring new things. It also requires a massive knowledge of game mechanics to survive and move on.

76561198095347673,"Lots of challenging but fair fun! The game follows three simple mechanics of Hunger, Sanity and health that all need to be monitored and kept up. The game delivers a challenging start to new players but this can be counteracted with the ability to increase and decrease certain aspects of the game world such as being able to increase the amount of food drops to monsters. The game feels rewarding after learning how to kill a new monster or surviving a new season and finally getting past the last milestone that you and your friends. The game falls short on teaching the player new stuff but that only drives players to learn for them self without a set by set guide on how to play. Playing with groups of friends feels rewarding and safe but also brings the new problem of keeping everyone fed.   Over all I think the game is well worth the purchase as long as you have people to play with. If you don't I recommend playing the first game.",True

This game stands alone quite well, regardless of whether you're playing by yourself or with a friend you coerced into playing this game through constant pressure and the offer of a free copy. But I digress. This game despite the lack of SW content provides what is in my opinion a much more robust version of RoG (and more) that truly provides a challenge to those playing alone or in a large group of inexperienced players. There is frankly a lot more to do in this game than even Don't Starve single player with RoG installed that is refreshing after playing over 150 hours of the other game feeling like you've run out of things to do unless you link to SW but that's a whole 'nother story.

But DST is great it only needs free events and updates that add 2 major things and thats it. All im asking for is to update DS to be like DST.

Don't Starve works excellently as a singleplayer game but something about playing it with other people can make the game significantly more fun.  ATTENTION: DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT HAVING MORE PEOPLE WILL MAKE THE GAME EASIER It doesn't get easier and in fact gets to be much harder in many ways. Sure you can have two things being done at once, and fight together, but you also need to worry about 2 sanity meters, 2 hunger meters, 2 health meters, and getting both people equiped for fights as you can't just equip one person for a fight. Having more people means you get to do stuff faster but have equally more stuff to do.

76561198139472718,"Don't Starve Together is a sequel/expansion to Don't Starve. As such, it comes with lots of small improvements to the original game. However, having played both versions, the only real game-changing difference this iteration has is its titular multiplayer feature. It's a great game to play with friends, and it's brought countless hours of fun in both the gameplay itself and the interactions which occur as a result of it. However, this game lacks the adventure mode of the original, which makes the gamplay kind of repetitive and doesn't give players an end goal to work towards, which might iscourage some people. If you're okay with the Minecraft-esque objective of simply ""stay alive and get good"", this game has a similar approach to progression. Bottom line is, this is a good game, but it's not a substitute to the original Don't Starve experience. I prefer the original as far as gameplay goes, but if you have some friends who also like the game, the ability to play and interact with them is well worth the price of admission.",True

76561198835106358,"I've loved the Don't Starve games since they first came out orignally in 2012. Since then, i've bought a copy of each, all I would recommend! Me and my friend both bought our own copies even if you can gift a friend it for free, more support to the devs, they clearly care about their work!   The Klei team as put so much love and effort into these games, the art style is unique and interesting, the gameplay lasts hours. Once Don't Starve Together came out, I needed to have it, and I finally do. I play tons with my close friend and it's become an often thing for us since we don't see each other much besides online. She was new to the game, and had never heard of Don't Starve, so I thought I'd introduce her too it. She loves it, and it runs smoothly on her (Trash, Potato, it's b a d) ""computer"". Both of us agree that it's a great game, the story is interesting, the art is wonderful, and whole game is honestly so different and fun. I'm normally nervous to play co-op games since I'm mostly bad at them, but for once i'm the player who teaches instead of dies constantly! The events are a new fun twist and are extremely challening but fun as well.  The point is, if you're looking for a new and unique, challenging experience with your friends, this is the game for you!  A little fun add on, we're addicted, we freak out whenever something new happens, you have no idea how loud the gasps of seeing a meese/geese land right next to us on the first day of spring were. Our little base is going well, besides almost burning it down... she has a great time yelling ""BURN"" with willow and then laughing like a mad man, as she plays as her (can't blame her). I have a problem with picking roses, I see one, it's mine, I don't care about the health I loose. She has a problem with rocks, she must mine a l l the rocks. I can't say we without it seeming like i'm talking about webber since I play as him, it's funny though when it does happen.

Don't Starve is a game where you will try to survive and its not easy because everything in the world will try to kill you. You will fight monsters, try to manage your food so you don't starve later, collect materials to craft better gear and gadgets, and try to survive in harsh environments like winter season.   You will starve, you will freeze and a psycho deer cyclops will destroy your hard earned home but Don't Starve is good because of these challenges, at first you will fail but you will try different strategies and will learn at the end.

76561198183183534,"This is a spectacular game. I've played since beta. The only complaints I have is that the internet and ping at my house is terrible, and yet I can't play the events even solo without intense lag. This would be fine during last year's forge, which I didn't favor much, but this year is different. This year (2018) is the Gorge Event. I'd love a few things to change about the game that I will include in the following list. -Each event you get to pick a free character and all their items, but only one ( I'd really like Winnona, this event is her only skin of her's I like and I feel it would make the whole community feel more loved if they got to pick a free skin of their choice to be able to remember the event every time they played) - The event ( now that there is a leveling system) would be optional to play at anytime, without the chests for leveling, but still gaining xp, to show what events you've played and be a nice reward for a new system of all year, all events. - I know this is a lot, and I'm only a single person reviewing, but I really like the farming mechanic and the alternate ways for cooking and think you should add them to the hamlet dlc for the original game.   General Ideas ( not as important as the other recommendations) -add claiming territory in pvp servers - maybe make it so if you get a common item in a regular chest you get 2 or so, making the trade inn more of a common thing to use instead of just people buying commons hoping for a more rare item to sell back on the market. - Tree house villages would be cool - more amazing puns, I loved the Prime-Ape in SW - You should add a demo/Free trial version so more people can expierience the game -not sure if i spelled that right - You should add events where people submit fan art of each character and the most popular ones get added as skins   In general this is fantastic, it would be cool if you considered some of the ideas in my first recommendations, but all in all don't trouble yourselves too much, you have made such a great masterpiece and I would hate to pressure you to change it or stress any of you at Klei out, Have a nice rest of the summer and enjoy it while you can.

76561197976040363,"Lots of fun.  The atmosphere in this game is quite unique and very well made.  While a lot of basic stuff (like crafting, some cooking recipies, gathering of Ressources like wood, stone, flint, ...) in the game is totally intuitive other things do require regular visits to a WIKI or some hardcore search-engine usage.  The characters all have their own advantages and disadvantages so they have to be played differently and I do recommend to use a mix of them when playing coop.   Don't Starve Together can be played alone, but the balancing has been adjusted for multiplayer although a collection of mods (for readjusting the balancing once more) can be used should you wish to play this version alone.  Fighting is easier for the host (especially against bosses) since latency issues can cause other players to recieve hits they would otherwise easily avoid. Avoiding hits is essential in boss fights so that can be quite a serious problem. Buuuut you might argue that bossfights are supposed to be difficult and they are still managable, even with that problem.   I love how many adjustable options there are for setting up a new world, like the abundance of Ressources, Enemy Spawnrates, Eventtimers, et cetera. New worlds can be made quite player-friendly for easy long time survival or extremely hostile for a bigger challenge and everything in between.",True

Don't Starve Together has unique Tim Burton style graphics and completely unique from any other game. This has to be the best survival game out there for a lot of reasons, but the main reasons are its ability to keep you going. You can't just stand around; you have to keep moving, collecting resources and food, and preparing for Winter if it's Autumn. To continue on, it becomes addicting and challenging real fast. Some people say this game is awful and one of the reasons is that there is no tutorial. Well, guess what bucko? Minecraft doesn't have a tutorial either. Tutorials aren't always necessary. Last, of all, the game has a combat system of prediction and strategy. Each monster and animal have their own way of defeating them which makes combat different for each thing you fight. You noticed the ""Together"" in Don't Starve Together right? Well, this game is multiplayer, meaning you can play singleplayer or private multiplayer with friends, or go on a public server alone or with friends.

The difficulty of this game is nice too, its very hard in the beginning and later when you learn the basics of this game you will find stuff much easier. graphics 9.5/10  The events are very good thing to spend time on, it requires time, speed and teamwork to achieve the best results. For now i am playing ""The Gorge"" Event and i need to say it is very hard but i love it! You never get bored by the content of the game because there is a lot of stuff you can learn. I hardly learned anything without the FanWIKI of DST, the game doesnt explain you the mechanics or has any tutorial for you. It just throws you in the wilderness and you need to find out how to survive. It can take you many games until you know what to do. Content 9/10  The multiplayer is very fun, you can play with your friends and join a server with up to 64 people! You can adjust the server with everything e.g How many mobs spawn,how long is a season,how big is the map etc. You can also add mobs to make your gameplay much easier like health bars, map huds and many more! I actually played this game for 4-5 days straight without getting bored. Fun 9/10  And the last thing is the price, i believe that the price is very good and if its on sale...well you gotta buy it 100% . Also you dont need to buy Dont starve and dont starve together cause the single player version comes with multiplayer (unless buying for a friend too). Price 9/10  I believe this game is totally worth it if your are a fan of survival games with hard difficulty, i've been looking for this kind of game for ages and i dont regret the price that i payed for. the price is totally equal with the content  Avarage Mark: 9.5/10 - Matt Approves",True

[h1][b]Random world generation[/b][/h1]  Every time you start a new game, the world will be randomly generated. You can edit the settings on how the world should be and what it should feature (see next point regarding this). This results in every world being unique and you can experiment with different play styles.  [h1][b]Customizable world[/b][/h1]  There is an absolutely amazing modding comunity for Don't Starve Together, but more importantly, every world you start is fully customizable in what it should feature. Here you can specify if there should be more of a type of creature, like rabbits, for example, to be able to gather more food, or less of a type of monster, like less or no hound attacks if you are struggling to survive. You can also adjust what season you start at, how long the days or nights are, the frequency of thunderstorms and many more.  [h1][b]Unique setting and eerie atmosphere[/b][/h1]  As mentioned earlier, the art style is very different to what we have nowadays with games. The story and setting of the game are shrouded in mystery and new-comers to the game will be scared of the monsters and how to fight them. The game mechanics of the darkness, sanity and seasons are fun ways of forcing the player to always do something and not just hide in a base and try to survive. You must be proactive in this game and learn to utilize the different resources, creatures and more importantly, sanity.  [h1][b]Free events[/b][/h1]  Right now The Gorge event is running which came completely free to the owners of the game. This is my first event and it is fun. It feels as a sort of 'big' mini-game, where you play in a completely different setting with other mechanics as the main game, keeping things fresh and giving the players opportunities to get new and wonderful cosmetics.  [h1][b]Conclussion[/b][/h1]  I haven't played this game for as long as I have wanted to, but it is an absolute blast to play. Every world feels unique and it is fun to always try new ways of playing. Definitely get this game, it is worth it for the full price which isn't that expensive anyways!",True

76561198083314790,One great game. Let's make a party?,True
76561198046455310,A very fun game. I really enjoy the artstyle and I think that it is of excellence that compares to no other. The characters all have their own unique abilities. For example the spider can lay eggs and grow a silk beard. The game is quite a challenge and the title should definitely not be taken lightly. Starvation and dehydration are the biggest enemies in this game. Forget packs of hungry hounds or losing sanity and being killed by shadow animals. You will always be on the hunt for food and water. This game has come very far and is still pushing through. A definite yes from me.,True

76561198255156918,"Hi people. This review is dedicated to Don't Starve Together. In this game I've been playing for more than 200 hours, and what can I say about this game? This is a multiplayer with unusual graphics and gameplay. After a few hours of playing, you will understand that everything is not so simple, today you are going to chop down a tree, tomorrow the tree is chopping you off. This game is designed to play with friends, because if you decide to go to the server, you will understand that there are either noobs or players who in every way want to spoil the game. So it's better to play with a good company. Personally, it's difficult for me to play with my friends, because they often like to have fun, because of this all problems turn into laughter, and later into the death of the whole team. I hope you are luckier than me. Have a good game, and a little luck!!!",True

Typically I am a graphics guy. I love (unlike a lot of gamers) the big triple titles. Needless to say, this is not my typical cup of tea. However, this game has depth like you won't believe. Just when you think you found the bottom of the rabbit hole you will figure out more you can do. I love the limitless nature. The freedom to go deep, or just run around and have fun. I would buy this game at full price because it's already a great value. If you get it on sale, you stole from the company.   This is not to say the game does not have problems, and I hope they continue to develop the game. Whatever content they release I will buy with no hesitation.",True
76561198174412303, Overall fantastic but the New Reign and other updates which add DST specific content feels more and more unlike Don't Starve. Honestly felt like I was playing a heavily modded version of the game - in my opinion kind of detracts from what I originally loved about the game. But no way near bad; just felt like it detracted from the original; and it is very unique and has a lot of content and a lot of things to learn about it.,True

At first you'll feel like it's basic but as you play you'll realise there's just so much to craft and so many things to take into consideration when surviving. I love this game, my girlfriend and I play it a lot together it's humorous in the sense that you can do stupid or funny things in game, like acciidentally burning your base down, or engaging a strong monster when you're not well equipped. I just love this game! Personally I see no flaws, as you can mod if you wish, or even tamper with the world settings to increase or decrease the abundance of basically everything. 10/10 for me.",True

It makes it more interesting when knowing if I screw up the game is pretty much over. I love the bosses in the game     and how some of them like the giants come to wreck your face even if you don't do anything. I also love the characters in the game because all of them are differant.

Yet I still find a way to get up to some antics on every server. Ever tried raising a beefallo in the middle of the summer with extremly low resources? Ever destroyed an entire server by spawning in a million tentacles with magical books? Ever hatched thirty tallbird eggs and then watching them all fight to the death? You can go on a server and eat food, do some emotes, make some tools and plant some grass. But thats not capturing the spirit of the game, were together damnit. You can get a crowd of people to all fight a giant bug in the middle of the desert, you can discover an ancient civilization underground and fight a giant skeleton monster. You can forge giant megabases that span entire biomes. With more people you can do whatever you want in this game twice as fast, and make it twice as fun.

However, even though it requires low graphics, and indeed it plays really smooth on my laptop (4 GB RAM, 1,8 Ghz), it can heat quite a bit, so you might want to consider taking a break between plays. This shouldn't stop you from having fun!  Some tips for first players like me: 1 - I read that in order to sleep, you need to build an 'item', but I died before getting a chance to sleep, so... lol; 2 - Don't to too far before collecting essential items.

Monsters that drive a wedge in your relationship and show other players how much you suck at foraging food in a really sketchy and mondo trippy realm of complete crazy bullcrap that seriously makes you wonder what the %4@& was in that coffee your wife just gave you.

76561198189728457,"Don't Starve Together is a Co-Op (or singleplayer) Survival (Horror/Cartoon) game entirely based around the theme of being dropped somewhere in the wilderness and having to survive on the environment around you. It uses the theme of ""horror"" well by incorporating it into the gameplay using insanity and the use of fire at nighttime, while the cartoon element takes out some of the ""horror"" aspect to make it much more spooky and playable for a larger player-base. That being said, the gameplay is really quite fun and fast-paced, making it so that you have to think about what you want to do next given that you only have so much time in each day. Each playable character has different perks, making each new world a new game and challenge for you to play. Especially fun with friends! I highly recommend getting this game!

76561198272383813,"I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is currently on the fence about buying it. After having spent close to 300 hours playing this game, I have yet to become bored with the gameplay, due in part to the wonderful job Klei is doing with special events, as well as the mods made by fellow players.  If you have enjoyed Don't Starve, you will highly enjoy this game, as it expands on the content found in the first game. If you haven't played Don't Starve, well, I really don't know what to say. Just go play it, then come back here. Now on to the things I really like. First, the art style. This game does an amazing job of making everything look whimsical, yet still somewhat threatening. Second, the game does not hold your hand or tell you what you should do next, nor does it explictly say what creatures will kill you. Third, this game can be brutal. If you and your friends die with no way to resurect, than that's it. You will have to start over in a new world from scratch. Can it be frustrating and rage inducing at times? Yes. Will you find yourself dying due to stupid mistakes? Yes. But over time and with enough patience, you will learn from your mistakes and become a better player due to your failures. Trust me, it feels really good to finally kill a boss after dying from it several times and being forced to start from scratch again and again. Furthermore, Klei has done a tremendous job of adding updates to the game to keep it fun, i.e The Forge. Overall, this is an amazing game, and I highly recomend it to anyone who likes survival/crafting games, or is simply looking for a challenge.  Nominated for the Steam Awards",True

A terrific game that allows easy to find mods to install that make the game easier, harder, more chalenging, or more cheaty.  Whatever you want.  Now I must say the artwork is absolutely fan-flippin-tastic.  Love the fact that the characters' voices are replaced with instrument sounds instead of real voices.  The gameplay is fun, learning how to do specifc things and discovering new things constantly as well with enemies and tools and crafts.  Not to mention how interesting it is how the characters all ended up in the area.  I rate the game 9/10.  Only thing missing that would make the game more challenging and difficult, as well as harder than focusing on food, would be adding a water meter.  Would pay for a DLC adding that.",True

The unlockables are great, with playtime rewarded with random drops of varying rarity, and special items that come around with each new seasonal event. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who are looking for a solid, enjoyable multiplayer game to share with friends.

The only issue I can say I have with Don't Starve is that it's probably one of the longer roguelike cycles which is probably intentional. It takes so long to get a half way decent camp set up that when you die, it doesn't have a pull to get back into the fray of it all, you feel you've genuinely lost all that stuff, which depending on your outlook may or maynot feel like a waste of time.

Highly recommended, I'll sing this games praises whenever I get the chance. It's provided hours of entertainment, solo and with friends. The first time I became totally self sustainable I was so pleased with myself, and then promptly died to Deerclops (beware winter!). I'm not sure what it is about Don't Starve, but I find myself itching to play it every few weeks and then will end u playing it for two days and barely doing anything else. It's been a favorite passtime for me and a couple friends in recent months, cooperating and getting each other killed has been a riot.  Friendly enough for beginners without holding a veterans hand and putting the kiddiemitts on, I recommend this for anyone looking for a good game that they can leave and come back to, or play for hours on end.

76561198321126402,It's a great survival game. Mods are great fo fix quality of life things that klei dont want to change (which is fine). The only thing I have noticed that bugs me a bit after 250 hrs is that certain characters are much better than others. I feel like a little tweaking has been in order for a while now. Other than that I was very happy with all of the regular updates to the game and the Forge was a lot of fun.  Update: For people with questions about this game in 2019. It is a great time to give this game a try if you've been on the fence about it. Klei's road map for DST in 2019 is very promising. New characters and re-works for current characters that need it are finally coming. Klei has also promised new content outside of characters and character changes. New biomes are set to come out a little later this year.   Why start now if the content isn't out yet? DST has a decent learning curve and getting an early start should put you in a good place to be comfortable with the game as the content drops month by month.,True

It's a great way to see how well your friends and yourself will last together. With more people come more challenges as food is scarce and resources can be hard to gather. Like normal Don't Starve, you are able to adjust the worlds to better suit your needs.  Beware as Giants roam the lands, and caves hold unknown terrors.  The only issue with Don't Starve Together is the fact that Caves require their own server, meaning that whoever is hosting has to have an ok PC to host both the above ground and Caves servers. Also having a strong internet connection is recommended if you have more than 3 people on at a time.  The story essentially takes place after Winston beats Maxwell and assumes the chair, though that is really a minor detail.

If you're a fan of the original Don't Starve and want to play it with your friends, GET THIS!!

76561198051826456,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  Few games match the charm and lovely, whimsical appeal of Don't Starve. But, visual uniqueness aside, Don't Starve is a deceptively deep survival game. You will likely die many times, but after each death you learn something new, and you will take that knowledge with you into the next world. Eventually, there will come a point where you have such a thorough understanding of the many different gameplay elements of the game that death will seem like some distant memory.   Indeed, once you've established a consistent means of obtaining food, and have fortified your base heavily enough, there will be little to threaten your survival. At which point, the game will evolve and you'll be able to enjoy the deeper layers of crafting and the challenges of obtaining that unique new item or weapon. And, if you've reached a point, like me, where you seem to have obtained everything you will ever need... And have no threats to your survival... You can just play the game in your off time to relax. There is something reallly therapeutic about this game.   From the moment I started playing the single player game, 'Don't Starve', I was hooked. I played that for hours and hours, and was reluctant to dive into 'Don't Starve Together' as I had assumed it was a multiplayer focused game, intended only for those that played with others. But I am here to tell you, I was wrong.  By all means, it's a fantastic game to play with friends. I played with my brother for a short while and I have to say, I enjoyed it a lot. The challenge of survival, of needing to obtain enough food to survive the night, was heightened with two mouths needing to be fed. However, just like in the original Don't Starve, this game is a joy to play alone, too.  So, please don't let the title fool you. Sure, it's a fantastic multiplayer game. But I have played many, many hours and am still living on the first world I created - day 400 something. All by myself.  What's more, the developers clearly have a great passion for this unique world they have created. They continually update the game, and have begun implementing entire new game modes to allow players to experience a whole new aspect of 'Don't Starve'. The Forge was an absolute blast and I eagerly await its return, and the arrival of new multiplayer experiences.  So, please, do yourself a favour. If you enjoy survival games, you owe it to yourself to check out Don't Starve.",True
76561198000785750,"A wonderful survival simulator that becomes exceptional when played with friends. It's open to mod support (but this can make the game unstable) which allows for even more end game content. While none of the systems are terribly deep, there's a lot here to keep you busy for 10's of hours. I've seen most of what the game has to offer in my 66 hours of co-op fun, but a close friend of mine has 500+ hours in the game. Want to get lost in the woods, cut down trees, mine rocks, build a base, plant a garden, and explore some caves with a friend in a charming and challenging world? This is your ticket.",True

76561198263371862,"first death to darkness. second death to starvation. third death to hounds. 11/10 would die again. super fun. :)  pros: - great and unique aesthetics - non-linear paths to ""survival"" - replayable due to random map generation - TONS of mini collectibles for skins and hats on your characters - multiplayer with friends you know in the same room is x100 times better (the shouting ahha) - outside of the regular survival mode, there was a limited time arena (called the Forge) mode, so semi-active development - active modding community to always enhance - EASY way to set up own servers/dedicated servers for friends, custom mods, etc.  cons: - mediumish learning curve AKA u will die and rage quit a bit - after a while, the ""optimal"" starting strat is figured out, so you tend to do the same thing -> kinda grindy/boring - no content expansion for the survival portion - once u go multiplayer, very hard to go back to single AKA u kinda need friends to play - NO ACHIEVEMENTSSSSSSS  notes: - about 60% of online communities are not from the USA, large Chinese population (not good or bad, just if u cant speak the language, sorta hard to interact)  verdict: would heavily recommend this game to friends unless they specifically hate survival games. 200+ hours into this game and im STILL learning new things!",True

I was foraging for supplies in summer minding my own business when one of the birds spontaneously caught on fire and cooked into an edible meal. My bro and I still talk about the ""hot birb"" incident. If I had known it was going to happen I would have recorded it.  It's a fascinating game fun to play on it's own but also great with others.

76561198129808248,"I love DST as you can see by my play hours. I have four main things I like about this game. -You survive in an uncomprimising wilderness with no instructions on how to do so. I reccomend looking some things up so you don't constantly die or worse starve. -Playing with friends makes this game so much better surviving together, dying together and starving together!  -The art and animations are great, very Tim Burton-esqe.  -The story and mystery I like too though you wont encounter any story while you play because most of it is hidden outside of the game. I hope this was helpful. Have fun not starving!",True

It is greatly reccomended to players who like a bit of challenge, hang out with friends, or simply just want to see how quickly they screw everyone over! Either way, this game is really fun, especially once you get the hang of it!  [u] What I like [/u] -Challenging -No real tutorial, you're thrown in and that's it -Option to play alone -No friends needed -Cooperative -Art Style -Events -Make the game a living hell for everyone else  [u] What I think could be used to improve the game [/u] -The ability to turn off events (unless you already can) -The ability to activate past events (Like The Forge, new players like me really wanted to experience that!)",True

In total, we have played it for 1,500+ hours and have never actually joined a community. It has been just us and the kids (three computers) starting world after world. (shout out to my older sister whom we recently got addicted to this game.) The customization in this game is astounding even without the incredible selection of user created mods. The devs are still active even thought they are also working on Oxygen Not Included. When we got this game, we were concerned that it would be too scary for the kids who were very little at the time. We were thrilled to discover that you can remove or avoid almost everything that might bother them. The only notable exceptions being the shadow creatures when you go insane (there is a command you can enter that increases your sanity (check the wiki)) and the ghost when you die.",True

76561198104112417,"UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.    When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.  Starting off: Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless  Survival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.  Wilderness: When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.  Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a ""Jury-Rigged Portal"" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the ""Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart"" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)  Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).  Characters -  Wilson:  Pros -  Grows a beard  Cons - None.  Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.  Willow:  Pros -  Doesn't Take fire damage Starts with a lighter (Infinte torch)  Cons -  When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires Can Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.  Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.  Wolfgang:  Pros -  Gets stronger on a full stomach Has more hp  Cons -   1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach Moves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach Loses more sanity in Night / Afternoon  Ah, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only ""Power up"" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.  Wendy:  Pros -  Has a ghost sister Doesn't lose much sanity in dark  Cons -  Does -.25% Less damage than all characters Loses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in  Wendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.  WX78:  Pros -   Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled / Stale and take no penalty. Can be charged by lightning Can eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.  Cons -  Takes Damage in the rain Starts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)  WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.  Wickerbottom:  Pro -  Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked. Able to craft her own books Starts off with 2 Papyrus.  Cons -  Can't Sleep Takes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food  Wickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.  The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.  Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.  EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY. PLEASE STOP ADDING ME",True

76561198141739390,"After achieving a good ammount of hours and experience playing this game, I thought it was a good time to update my review.  Don't Starve Together, or DST, continues to be a lovable mess that is extremely enjoyable and endearing to play.  A survival game at its core, it is challenging enough to make certain players to starve to death without proper care and knowledge on how it can be survivable and joyfull. It is a harsh learning curve and always a challenge from the start, which makes it highly replayable.  Further supporting ""replayability"" are the characters present in the game, which, hold the game together by their diferent atributes, perks and flaws. Making the game easy in some aspects, however, hard on others.  Has a final point that I personally love about the game is the artwork itself. It is unique in its approach and portraits uniquely the gray area between insanity and sanity, from vibrant colors to shadowy and dark colors that can terrorize in your nightmares.  Be ready for a thrilling adventure.",True

Be warned, there are spoilers in the World Generator parameters, if you haven't played much.

I mostly play Don't Starve and not Don't Starve Together, but from my short experience with this specific version, I can say that it is just as good as the original. The graphics are unique and interesting, yet also high quality. The monsters and characters are all unique. Each character has pros and cons and are balanced.  My only issue with it is that some of the bosses are far harder than they should be. As in, they have way more health than they really should; the Dragonfly, who was already hard to defeat, now has 27000 health, which is overdoing it in my opinion. The Toadstool has even more health and doesn't even have half-decent drops. However other bosses like the bearger, deerclops and moose/goose are balanced.

76561198114828853,"[h1] Don't Starve Together is a super fun co-op survival game that offers a lot of replayability and depth [/h1]   A 2D, cartoony, isometric game that offers so much to do in terms of content, gameplay, replayability (randomly generated maps) and [b] teamwork! [/b]   I think [i] Don't Starve Together [/i] might be one of the best survival games in the past decade...  you can tell a lot has been put into this indie game and the devs update it REGULARLY!   [h1] Gameplay [/h1]   So you can begin your game by picking a cast of some pretty unique playable characters with their own little 'perks' or 'starting items/equipment' that can synergize well with each other (early game/later game).  But if it's your first time, [b] just pick whoever you think LOOKS COOL/INTERESTING! [/b]  [i] It does start off slow, but the more time you put into it, the more rewarding it is! [/i]   You'll then start of your adventure by spawning in a random location on the map.  After that, it's all up to you to [i] collect, gather, cook and kill [/i] and do whatever it takes to survive!    [i] If you get really confused or just don't know what to do, there are always guides and the Don't Starve Wiki! [/i]   You can unlock some [b] cool cosmetic skins [/b] just by playing or you can buy it from the Steam Market/in-game store!   - Although I haven't played much Solo, I thoroughly enjoy my time playing it [b] with friends [/b] - as most people would recommend doing so too!    [h1] Performance [/h1]   - In terms of PC requirements, you can pretty much run this game on any computer without needing a next-gen graphics card. I have played it on my potato 2013 laptop with Integrated graphics and it runs pretty well!   [b] HOWEVER, hosting a server will take some resources from your computer, so if you have a potatoaster PC, I suggest letting someone else host! [/b]  - There are a [i] few lag/ping spikes [/i] when playing multiplayer, however, but as long as you have a decent internet connection you should be fine.  Overall, the game does run fairly well/smooth FPS-wise.   [h1] Graphics/Visual Style [/h1]   - This game has a very distinct, artistic visual style that seems so [b] fitting [/b]. It has a cast of very whacky/funny, whimsical characters that gives off a very [i] Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton [/i] feel to it. I personally LOVE IT and is one of my favorite things about this game!   [b] AUDIO - SOUND EFFECTS: [/b]  Again, a lot of the things sound very quirky and has a lot of personality in it.  From gathering grass to your character talking - it is very imaginative yet distinct so you know know what's happening.   All in all, you can tell it doesn't take stuff [b] too [/b] seriously and there are some funny/quirky/cute things that are quite cheesy.  Although there is an underlying darker theme (the Darkness, starvation, survival) in terms of the characters' lore/backstory.   -   I cannot stress enough how fun it is to play with friends/other players, as you need a lot of micro-management, resource management and teamwork/communication to survive for a long time.  Of course, a lot of the resources that spawn are dependent on [b] RNG [/b], but [b] THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE GAME FUN/CHALLENGING! [/b]  Good job, Klei!  This game is worth every penny and I hope you guys have a blast.",True

76561198070770461,This quickly became one of my favorite games. It is really difficult and resource management is key here. Its really easy to run out of pretty much everything if you are not carefull. And definately better playing with friends. Playing by yourself is kind of boring. If you do play with friends though I suggest getting the global positioning mod. Doesnt change the gameplay at all. All it does is show you where your friends are on the map and shows you where they have been. Makes it much easier to meet up with each other if you travel far. Last thing. Unless you have a semi-decent computer I dont suggest making a map with caves. My computer is still fairly good for its age but even the overworld lags when I tried to play with caves. Even though normally I am fine.,True
