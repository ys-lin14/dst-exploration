Each time you start a new world you make it slightly further than you did the last time only to die to a new aspect that you never knew before. Takes several times to get a mechanic, but once you do the you can finally start learning the other aspects of the game such as crafting and fighting. Playing with friends makes the game 1000x more enjoyable. This game is a deal breaker I see potential in losing friends over this game :p 11/10 would recommend",1452657532,True

You can build a home base, food and material farms, traps for mobs trying to kill you, clothes to help you survive summer and winter among many other nifty things!  Seasons have different effects on your world such as different mobs acting based on the current seasons, in summer wild fires can occur but fear not as you can protect your base by building ice throwing machines!  Mine rocks for ore for your base and tools but beware meteor fields! One hit and you're dead...  The fun is doubled in multiplayer mode with friends as many crazy things tend to happen... Trust me on this one!  Overall a very recommended purchase you will (most likely) not regret!  Also: Exterminate beefalo herds with traps and be the bad boy!

It can be completely unforgiving when you die (the default setting for servers is game over once everyone dies) or you can set it to be resurrected by clicking on the portal (endless). You can run around collecting things and trying not to die. The customization of how many of everything spawns in a server determines how easy or hard the game is and makes for good balance based on player experience level. The developers are consistently working on new DLC and content so it's worth coming back to. There's plenty of enemies to fight and things to build. There's seasons with different challenges to overcome (winter requires warm clothing, summer requires things to cool you off, etc). Mods are easy to implement into the game and keep the replayability high. Overall, a pretty decent game to play by yourself or with a bunch of friends.",1450912095,True

Some people have created characters but have caused an error for the game in which it does NOT allow you to start up the server.

Its amazing to get on and have your own adventure with friends or people you have never met just beware of the willow trolls.

Ever since, I've been so interested in the characters, the story, the function, the play experience... It sucked me right in, and it's such an immersive experience with quirky characters and equally terrifying mobs.  The Klei Development team themselves seem to be active in he community, on their forums, at least, actively working on updates and bugs, should one ever come up.  The only thing I might add is that... perhaps a DST rendition of Adventure Mode could be added for additional challenge. I can see that being loads of fun.

So the game is basically a multiplayer online game where the point of it is to go as long as you can without getting killed or dying in some way shape or form. The biggest fault of the game is it gets boring after a few hours so be sure to give mods a chance if you dont like the game itself. The biggest pro of the game is that it is great for having a good time with friends and working together. Overall I think this game is a great buy for anyone who likes survival games.

Believe me it's stupid to see someone randomly hitting the air and running around to avoid shadows. - keep yourself healthy - stay out of darkness - make yourself warm during winter - make yourself dry during the rainy days - and fighting random monsters coming to your way  It is a good survival game with cute graphics and i fell in love the moment i first tried the game.  Moreover it is quite easy to play it with friends! You can host your game for free and ask your friends to join or vice versa. Just make sure both of you have sufficient internet connection so all of you could play well and have fun. Or you could just join some dedicated server and meet some strangers out there!

It's definitely really, really fun to play with friends, and the mod support is excellent. however, finding your friends is extremely difficult...  summer is also a huge pain, and so is fire. certain items help prevent things but the method of acquisition (if you don't mess with the settings) is kind of very late game, despite seasons coming and going quickly.T here are certain methods that make restoring things, but there's just so much going on, it feels like a clutter of things.

And oh boy, it was - and still is - one of the most special and interesting, as well as fun and challenging multiplayer games for me to play, even tho I mostly played in co-op.  The game doesn't differ much from the original ""Don't Starve"" except it's on multiplayer mode, featuring the possibilities of surviving in a small group - with or against other players... This means it's the same survival background and the same game mechanics, which is great since ""Don't Starve"" already features loads of great content and pretty much offers you a great singleplayer which you now can enjoy with many of your friends or strangers! Surviving in the mysterious and dark world of ""Don't Starve"", hunting down monsters from the ""Reign of Giants""-DLC and (probably soon) exploring the beautiful iles of the ""Shipwrecked""-DLC is a challenge in the original game, and it still is in the multiplayer - but it doesn't feel as lonely, and for me (peronally) it's one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had!  Thus I strongly recommend you to buy this game if you like the singleplayer or if you're interested in survival games with a multiplayer in general! If you have neither the single- nor the multiplayer you should check out the ""Don't Starve MEGA PACK"" - it's really worth the money, especially if it's on sale!

76561198074644085,"This game receives a lot of credit from the start of my review for being so incredibly unique. Allow me to begin with a brief yet relevant tangent: the ever-growing community of gamers in today's technologically advanced society has brought about more and more games being produced with each passing day. And as great as that is, a lot of these games have begun to look the same. Call of Duty, Battlefront, Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, they all satisfy the exact same prerequisites to create a wartime, pro-America, FPS videogame, and they all appeal to the exact same audience. I'm not saying these are bad games by any means; as a matter of fact they are each highly successful franchises in their own regard. All I'm saying is that they're all too similar to one another. After playing just one, I get the point. Shoot the bad guys, dont let them shoot you. There's nothing noticeable enough to distinguish them from their competitors, but the demand for such games is large enough that they can share the market.  Now back to the review: Don't Starve is NOT one of these games. And that's why I love it so much. It almost categorizes itself into its own genre, and I applaud that endlessly in this day and age. The permadeath feature of the game is frustrating to the novice gamer for obvious reasons, but there are in-game settings to adjust the penalty for dying. The gameplay itself is exhilerating, especially when coordinating strategies among friends (although if you're anything like my friends you'll spend hours screaming at each other over Skype), but that's all part of the fun. The world is vast, and there are lots of areas to explore, enemies to kill, and loot to find and craft. The goal is blatantly simple, but the means of completing the goal are devastatingly complex.   All in all it's a great game at a great price, and it's often times on sale (I bought it for $10).  Two thumbs up!",1451442621,True

Pros Fresh gameplay experience/style Encourages exploration instead of camping down on one spot for too long This game has an ending if you want to beat the game but you can always build a home. Has a lot of unique elements and playstyles of the game.

As in, you have to find more food, more materials for tools, armor, etc. It is especially hard with multiple people when it comes winter time.    (I find it troubling because of the scarce food supply, and crops not growing because they're frozen over.)  But I do just love playing alongside my friends, and beating monsters that would otherwise be challenging. The downside is that every few minutes, I get disconnected. I'm not sure if it's a bug, or if it's my friend's internet (he hosts). Also, when someone leaves, it still counts them in when the hounds come. Like, if you have your server set to 4 players, and they all join, then 2 leave, it still sends (x) amount of hounds as if the whole 4 players were in the game.

I like it because there's no major plot or objective to it, than simply -don't die. There are numerous ways your time could be cut short. And your only task is to overcome it. Build, create, struggle, and if you're doing it good enough, thrive.  There are however numerous ways the co-op aspects of the game can be ruined to the point of aggravation. The greatest reason for this is because it is vulnerable to ""griefers"" who destroys everything you've built up (hence why I only play with trusted people, sadly). Another thing being the lack of options for ressurrection early on, in case one of you happens to die. In contrast to the single player version of the game, where you can just restart.

76561198003156862,"I bought the Frontier pack for EUR9,99 during a Steam sale and I'm not fully convinced the game is worth this much. I have had fun playing it, the plus sides are:   - Well-working multiplayer (at least I've had zero problems), the server remembers where you left off, easy-to-create servers etc  -Exquisite graphic & sound design with a very distinguished artistic approach. Many people say it's like Tim Burton, but I'm most reminded of a cardgame called Gloom  - Pleasant sound FX  What I do not like:  - The Minimap. I'm guessing it's an early access thing (or maybe not?), but I would like to see where my partner is. I mean, if it's meant to ""make the game more challenging"", it's failing, because we oriented with the Portal (e.g I'm 9 squares south-west of the portal), but it's just tedious and boring. Why not add the other players on the minimap?  - The Minimap - progress. I hate the fact that I'm losing progress when I die. I mean, my character still knows the surroundings, I became a ghost and then was resurrected, right? So how do you justify me losing my memory? Again, it's just tedious.  - The scarcity of resource in some areas. Okay, so I get that it's a survival game and you're supposed to feel ""tense"", but it's a completely different thing if me and my friend spend one entire day looking for ANYTHING edible and we find one berry bush. One playthrough, we went 5 days never meeting a carrot/berries. If you dont have carrots, you cant kill bunnies either with your trap... It's just that sometimes, it became superboring to go through a similar empty landscape. There are so many interesting choices to be made - e.g make a toxic mushroom field, where you have mushrooms that do relieve your hunger, BUT drain sanity or something like that. The tensity disappears quite soon if there is no resources available. Paired with the minimap issues, it becomes excessively annoying, because you need to go far away from each other to scout for resources, but finding each other again (unless your meeting point is the portal), will be very tedious.   Overall, I think it's an enjoyable filler game and probably fills the niche of ""what to play with your girlfriend"" so here's one couple-LAN-party game.

76561198090383305,"I found Don't Starve Together rather enjoyable, it's very fun, and very easy to play. Klei have done an amazing job coding the original Don't Starve into this multiplayer version and it's obvious that they've done a brilliant job doing so. The game itself consists of a 2D/3D background with a cartoonish grey outlook where your aim is to survive as long as possible until you die, depending on whether you have a friend on your game with you, there will or won't be a chance to respawn. If a friend is on with you then he/she can craft a ""Telltale heart"" to bring back a dead player at the cost of 20 health, 3 grass and a spider gland. Dead players cause sanity loss on living players and can roam around ""haunting"" objects and creatures. Perhaps later on as an idea for haunting, the dead player can control the object/animal depending on sanity and having low sanity can allow you to control bigger and more ""alive"" creatures/objects.  Don't Starve Together also brings the concepts from Reign of giants into the game, such as the actual ""giants"". These giants seem to be seasonal with ""bearger"" at autumn, ""Deerclops"" at winter, ""???"" (or goose/moose) at spring and ""Dragonfly"" at summer. These Giant enemies bring a new challenge to players and can bring games to an end because of the high attack damage they possess. This can be a rather difficult challenge for players as giants such as ""deerclops"" can come out of the darkness in winter and destroy your base/encampment.    Don't Starve Together also brings new characters and character concepts into the game, such as ""Wigfrid"" a warrior woman who can only eat meat and has her own character locked weapon and armor called the ""Battle Spear"" and the ""Battle helm"", I found this very useful and fun to be able to use a new weapon which won't bring down sanity, however the character itself can be rather restrictive as when I played as ""Wigfrid"" I felt as if I were restricted to my base as I could not wander too far from my food source which was rabbit traps. Perhaps ""Wigfrid"" could eat food and it would be more filling so that it makes up for the fact that if there is was little meat left the character won't die so fast of hunger and allow for players such as myself to be able to explore without too many restrictions.   ""Webber"" is another addition to the game and is described as (""Is a monster, befriends spiders, grows a silky beard"") he is a very good addition to the game and grants a bigger freedom in the game as the character can eat a wider variety of foods such as monster meat, which I found as a brilliant idea for a character. The character itself though get's attacked by ""Pigs"" if the character gets in a close proximity and this can be very repetitive and persistent, this is a good idea at best but perhaps the character ""webber"" could just be unable to befriend ""Pigs"" and just instead of being attacked just avoided.  Overall I found the game very enjoyable and would be happy to see any improvements in the game such as previously stated and caves which I'm sure Klei are working hard on.",1446984505,True

76561198332529760,"The epitome of Chaos  Day 1: My friends and I coup at spawn, and rummage our surroundings for resource. Kooper begins as WX-78, he's quite new to the game. Jacob goes for Webster, he's new as well, but knows that guides exist. I go for Willow, I'm the most experienced player of us all.  Day 3: After my friends nearly starve and I've gained 31 gold, we rendezvous at the Florid Postern to scour the darkness with a camp fire, followed by a science and alchemy machine. Numerous threats are administered between my friends as I plan for what's to come  Day 6: I successfully implement 2 farms into our settlement, and a bee box follows a few minutes later. It's not much, but it's a minor amount of regenerable food.  Day 12: We're beginning to have food issues. 3 mouths isn't easy to feed with such a small area to rummage around, especially with such a slow revitalization rate that the plants have. To make it worse, Glen, another friend, joins the server. He plays as Wendy.  Day 13: At dusk, we hear them. The hounds. They're dead, and I'm left with 13 health. Just before the cloak of night, 3 claps of thunder can be heard in the distance as they revive at a touch stone.  Day 16: Jacob is having lots of trouble with maintaining his sanity. Numerous times he has hit single digits, and nearly ended this escapade if I hadn't had Bernie.  Day 19: We're all starving, and the long nights that keep us stuck around the campfires isn't certainly helping. Winter is on the horizon, and we're not prepared what so ever.   Day 21: The first morning of winter, the snowbirds appear. Things head south, we're freezing, and Willow's inability to stay in the cold is certainly crippling my abilities.   Day 23: We've run bankrupt, there's nothing left. Then the thought hits me as my friends fight for the last monster lasagna cooking in the crock pot, the caves. They're our only hope.  Day 24: Our sanity is barely anything. I'm on the brink of 20, and the rest have single digits. Jacob has officially reached 0 sanity. We make our run to the nearest clogged sinkhole, I have to stay back to keep myself warm with a forest fire from my lighter.  Day 26: We've set up camp in the caves, and things aren't going well. Jacob, as Webster, is exiled by the nearby pack of rabbit men, and has to live in isolation. He dies mere minutes later as darkness envelopes him and his base. There isn't any hope of revival, with no touch stones or spider glands to use, he's done until we reach spring.  Day 29: They're all dead, they starved. It's only me. I shouldn't have eaten that lightbulb, should I?  Day 30: Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. 0 sanity. My days are numbered.  Day 34: I make a stance with only 2 days left until I can return to the surface. I'm so close, I just have to keep this up for 2 more days.  Day 35: I try to regain sanity, staying as close to the fire as possible with my rotting garland onto of my head. Bernie fends off the darkness as the spiders crusade upon the rabbits that provide my second sense of defense.  Day 36: I'm free, It's time. Winter is over. At least, I think it is.  I make my way to the surface. Bad decision. A group of snowy hounds have been waiting vigilantly at the gates to the surface. Turns out day 36 was the last day of winter, not the first day of spring.  I die, I have no defense, no sanity, and no direction of where to go beyond this point.  We lasted 36 days.

Its visuals, its music, its characters - all of it pops out in such beautiful charm, and the gameplay has such a simplistic style that it makes you invest in it, and the more you invest, the more you discover and thrive as a player. You are going to die. A lot. Whether it be to starving, to the darkness, to your own insanity, or even to spiders. Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand. But you get better, you learn from your mistakes, and you overcome your weaknesses.   I rarely play online with strangers, but with a group of friends, it is a blast. Huddling together at night, working hard during the day, using your character's strengths to work with those of others, it's so much fun. You build and build until you realise that you're all, in a funny way, a family. A bunch of people stranded and who must work together.   Get this game.

I need a few more hours played to be absolutely sure, but I think after a little over 3000 hours under my belt that I have figured out, mostly, how not to starve! Klei Entertainment is hands down the best company making games.  They hardly ever disappoint their audience, and if you don't like something, and you tell them about it politely, you'll get a reply explaining things. There are a lot of survival games nowadays, but DST is unique. There is no manual, it is a sink or swim game. And you die at first, over and over again. But there is something about being afraid of the dark that they tapped into. When you first start playing you fear nightfall because in DST, as in it's predecessor Don't Starve, there really ARE things out there that will kill you when night falls. Of course, other things are happily trying to kill you in the daylight, too. There is a lot of fun in the game, and Klei's programmers have a wicked sense of humour and a love of punning! This game has got better and better over the years. Since December of 2014 the Don't Starve universe has consumed a huge amount of my time and I still play one or other version every day. And I still die! But not of starvation.  Edited Nov 26th 2019. After another 450 hours or so, I have to say that I finally learned how to die infrequently. And that I really like this game.

Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.  As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.   If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.  Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently.

76561198090104888,"Don't Starve Together is a game that I can say quite a lot about even as someone who hasn't played the original Don't Starve. If you are wanting to buy this game, but you intend to only play it by yourself, then I strongly suggest you stop now, don't get this game, and get the original Don't Starve along with its DLCs instead. If you still want to get this game, then I'm just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you'll need to know stuff about the original Don't Starve as well.   You don't need to know the plot of the original game to know what Don't Starve is about. Even though it is a sequel in a way, you don't need to know what happened. Basically, you're going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal, survive as long as you can. There is a lore to the game, and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it's really interesting and ever so more expanding. The world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do, but it's that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it.   Right off the bat, the game spews charm from it. From character and monster designs, to the artstyle, the old vintage look, and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have. I can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme.   You'll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you'll play as, each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other. For players who have already played Don't Starve, you won't have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked, they're all unlocked right out of the gate. Also for players who have played Don't Starve, the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer. Each character fits a different play style so you'll never feel as though you're playing as the same character, and you can feel the differences with each character and you'll find someone with a playstyle who you'll enjoy playing as the most.  This game is not easy and if you are new, you'll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do. The game is not going to teach you anything, you'll either have to learn to survive as you play, learn from other players, or research about the game. At no point are you ever going to be safe. You'll have to eat to keep yourself from starving, find ways to restore your character's sanity so that way you don't go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures, fire can spread and destroy precious resources, some resources can't respawn, some creatures will attack and try to kill you, and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day. Even changing seasons will be a hazard as you'll either have to survive the cold of winter, the storms of spring, or the heat of summer. It may be hard to get into first, but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays, it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to. You'll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you'll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long.  The one thing that stands about this game over the original Don't Starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people. You can play by yourself, but it won't be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the Steam Workshop. If you're going to play this game with others, I highly recommend playing with friends.   If there is one thing I can say about this game is that it will get reptitive. Once you get the hang of the game, it's just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it, you'll have nearly nothing to worry about.   If you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends, this game is definitely for you and I can highly recommend it to others. Even though it can get repetitive after a while, I still find it to be a fun game where you'll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going, and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it, I can see it being supported for a long time.",1509856904,True

Honestly, the level of dedication the developers have to churning out new content FOR FREE* almost every other month is astounding, especially considering the game has been out since 2016.  Now, to gameplay itself. You will die, a lot, and you'll enjoy it. This game has enough depth to keep you interested for months, and depending on the amount of people you're surviving with, this dynamic will also be different each time. Different character combinations will shift your survival focus to different things.  Also, it's not just a sandbox where you survive to explore a procedurally generated world -- there are certain events to complete, bosses to beat and set pieces to make function and take advantage of, all of them require planning and numerous attempts.   Again, you will die a lot, but preparing for it is a challenge in itself. Building a self-sustaining base with your friends is fun, figuring out ways to beat bosses and survive seasons is fun (I advise you to hold off Youtube and wikis for a while and take pleasure in working out game mechanics yourself).  All in all, this game is a gift that keeps on giving. I strongly recommend the game for all seeking either a casual experience with your friends, or a challenging survival sandbox that has both style and depth to keep you entertained for months.   *bar 2 out of 15 characters, one of which you get for free if you own the Hamlet DLC for the original game.

76561198194237109,"I am just a new player. So far too good 11/10. This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...  If you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).  Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.

76561198290310711,"[b]**NOTE: This review will be constantly updated to accomadate any changes in my opinion, updates, etc.**[/b]   [h1]INTRODUCTION[/h1]  I heard a lot of good stuff about Don't Starve Together, and I've watched some of my favorite YouTubers play the game. That's probably what drove me to buy it. My friend also happened to have Don't Starve Together, so we could play together. The game definitely isn't as much fun without friends, lemme tell ya.  So the game was fifteen dollars. It seemed like a pretty decent price, and I thought, ""well, why the heck not?"" So, to checkout I go. I had HIGH expectations, and I was worried that since I kind of knew about the game already, I would miss out on the experience of exploring it myself.  Haha... I'm laughing because I was an idiot.   [h1]WHAT DON'T STARVE TOGETHER IS[/h1]  Don't Starve Together has the amazing features of Don't Starve, except it's multiplayer and there's a different story. The art is dauntingly adorable. What do I mean by that? The art sets you into a world about survival and its dangers. I seriously love it. The type of art compliments the gameplay style perfectly, and it makes the game [i]that[/i] much more enjoyable.  You're thrown into an unforgiving world. There are tons of monsters, darkness that will swallow you whole, and lands that will try to kill you. But along with this sparks fascination. You have to survive in a crude world, learning along the way, picking up tips & tricks, and gathering tons of knowledge.  This is definitely my favorite survival game. It has greath depth, it's compelling, and extremely creative. The crafting aspect is fun, and exploring things is just simply enchanting.  The [b]purpose of Don't Starve Together[/b] is to play with friends, and I definitely recommend so. It's much more fun if you play with other people.  I usually recommend buying Don't Starve Together instead of Don't Starve, because in DST (Don't Starve Together) you can play both singleplayer and multiplayer. The only difference is the story. DST's story is a continuation of the original and classic Don't Starve. But honestly, the story isn't as important in my opinion, as the game can be a total sandbox and is much more valuable because it has multiplayer. It's meant more to be a sandbox type game, but the story can be important (it depends on the player).  If you're someone who doesn't play mutliplayer, then get Don't Starve. Otherwise I recommend Don't Starve Together. Even then, there are public servers you can join and play with other strangers.... totally trustworthy.  [h1]PLAYING[/h1]  I really, [i]really[/i] love this game. So far, I've played 130 hours in total. I wasted a lot of time. ([i]A lot[/i]). There's a lot to explore, and with 130 hours... I honestly haven't gotten into half the game yet! I know. I should've by now. But there's a seriously fun aspect with Don't Starve Together that won't let you drop it, and I'm surprised I haven't written this review sooner.  The great part is, there are tons of different mods created by the community that can impact your game. You should really get them. They're awesome, and yes, trustworthy. They're located in the workshop (in case you're wondering). And they seriously make your game much more fun. If you ever get the game and want to know what mods I recommend, please message in the comments below. There are lot of different mods, but there are some extremely important ones that make your game easier and more immersive.  Exploring was so much fun. The whole aspect reminds me of Stardew Valley, but to me there are a lot more things to discover in Don't Starve Together, and with friends it's amazing. You really shouldn't underestimate the game. It has a lot to offer, and is popular for a fantastic reason: it's purely great.  [i]""It's definitely a better game with friends. And it can be spooky & scary, especially if you don't know what's going on (rlly now?). I swear if you write this word for word-""[/i] - Quote from Kuep.   ^^^ He read it. [i]""You're a spaghetti-o-""[/i], he says.  Don't Starve Together is very unique, comedic, and fun overall. Much recommendation. I had a lot of moments where I died laughing, a lot of ""WTF"" moments, and honestly the game is a great excuse to have a good time with your friends. So if you wanna trick people into liking you, play this with them.  [h1]THE PROS[/h1]  - Adorable art. It fits the game perfectly, and you will love it's cuteness.  - Fun characters. Each default character has a backstory and unique personalities and weapons.  - Mods. Mods made by the community that makes your game extremely fun. You will love your life once you get them. Seriously.  - Exploration. Lots o' exploration. Lots o' fun. Enuff said.  - Challenge. The game offers challenges to those who like it, and even with normal gameplay you have to survive hunger and sanity. You can customize your settings to what you want on Don't Starve Together, and I really think that's fantastic.  - Uniqueness. It may have the classic but fun ""survive"" theme, but it has unique gameplay (you'll see what I mean if you buy it. Which you should.)  - Constantly updated. Constantly updated with new and old things from Don't Starve, and that's great. Games that don't update sometimes get boring, but with an alive workshop community and constant updates, that sure won't happen soon.  - Music. It's daunting. It's revving. It's themed perfectly. What more could you ask for?   [h1]THE CONS[/h1]  - Connection issues. Sometimes even though your wifi works on both ends servers get a little laggy, but it doesn't happen that much. Watch out if the person hosting the server has terrible wifi. You will hate them and your life.  - Imcompatible mods. This is not really a con, but it IS something you should be aware of. There are mods in the workshop that won't work with each other, and sometimes they will crash your game. This is annoying because if you subscribe to a lot of mods you have to go through each one to see which is crashing your game. For the most part, most mods are working fine. It's more of the, ""ehhhh""-looking mods that don't work, (which is kind of obvious).  - Sometimes crashes. Sometimes Don't Starve Together has file issues and crashes your game. It happens rarely, but it is something to watch out for. No, none of these crashes deleted any of my progress, which is excellent. The game autosaves quite frequently. (Now that I think about it I've never had to save myself... Wait is there even a manual save button???)   [h1]PLACES TO IMPROVE[/h1]  - Crashes. Please fix file issues that occur randomly. A lot of users do have this, but as I said, it doesn't wipe any progress whatsoever.  - New biomes. I would love if there were new biomes. Something fascinating.  - New items. I would like new items. Once you play the game you realize there isn't that much diversity, but that's where mods come in! Hah. Still please make new items. <3   [h1]DON'T STARVE YOURSELF HESITATING TO BUY THE GAME (I'm bloody hilarious)[/h1]  It's fun as hell, and I had a lot of fun with this game. It is a game where you have to constantly look out for not dying, but there's [i]so[/i] much fun being chased to death by hounds. Trust me. It's a first-time experience. (I don't know if it is for you, though... o_o). And the fact that everyone is screaming that there's a gigantic black flea trying to chomp you (aka, the hounds) makes it all-the-while.  I want to stress about the art, because it really does fit well. I think it's perfectly suitable for the game, and it's extremely likeable as well.  This is a game I definitely recommend. A lot of fun, with challenges, and the great survival aspect I love. It's very original, and the characters are extremely comedic. The game can even be relaxing if you choose for it to be, or it can be freaking death chasing after you every split-second of your existence.

76561198043774270,"Excellent survival game with a unique artstyle and consistenty strange personality. One of the few actually complete survival games, with tons of stuff to discover and run away from!   In this online co op version of the original game, not only do you get to play with friends, but you also get the reign of giants dlc for free! I'm a bit perplexed as to why the original game doesn't have this content as well yet though (included).  In don't starve you do exactly what the title suggests. find food. Food is essentially the most important thing in the game, being the sole reason to venture out and gather things. If you don't keep finding food, you eventually starve. There are plenty of other dangers of course, but ultimately, it's that constant need for food that really makes it a challenge. Wolves? No problem. Giant dragon flies? Peice of cake. Carrots? SHIT WE RAN OUT OF CARROTS.   This game is so much more fun with other people. Sure, it was fun alone, but the dynamics of co op really make it extra fun. Your friend might accidentally provoke an army of pigs to murder them, then you have to go rescue them and you then spend 10 days trying to recover the health and sanity you lost, ultimately crippling your preperation for winter. THAT is the sort of wonderful stuff that can enrich your experience. And obviously, friends aren't always a burden. YOU might be the burden at some point and they get to rescue you. Or you can all share food with eachother. It's just really really fun.   Definitely recommend this game.

I liked the earlier game but I always found it too stressful.

76561197967159739,"This is a fun co-op survival game, though game mechanics discourage larger servers.   Dead players bring the 'sanity' of live players down, so on large servers (which are more likely to have a dead player at any given moment), your 'sanity' is threatened more often. Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers.   Communication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.  On top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.  All of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge.",1418766878,True

However, the lag can be fixed with a simple restart of the server which takes like 2 minutes max -This isn't really a con, I just dont understand it?

They are not nearly as brutal as the original game, by merit of having help.  It's still a grueling survival game, but on larger games it can get quite well established, to the point where most threats aren't even a concern.  The ghost mechanic is also a little annoying for when you're playing the game socially, and mostly want to just enjoy time with friends, since the optimal course of action for someone who is in ghost form, who can't immediately be ressurected, is to log out of the server.

Luckily that is not the case because basically anything might kill you if you don't watch out! Various beasts, catastrophes, shadow figures or feeble-minded pigs might cross your way and won't make it easy for you to stay alive in this rough world. So why not invite some friends? The title says it all, other than the Singleplayer: ""Don't Starve"" here you should probably bring some company to explore the world and exist against those horrible creatures. But if it wasn't difficult enough.. the weather won't be on your side for long either. It might be rather challenging to play this Game and there are a lot of mechanics and tricks that make DST unique, but you will need quite some experience to figure them out. The very charming graphics and humor will make you love the Game quicker than you want.[/i]  [u]Characters:[/u] You can select from a lot of different characters for your journey, who all have their very personal Pros & Cons. The specific abilities and weaknesses make the gameplay exciting and miscellaneous everytime again, trust me.. From Robots and Spiders to Scientists and Warrior Valkyries your choice is kind of unlimited (even more and better characters are still developed) and up to you and your fellow survivors.  [u]Base Building:[/u] Of course you can wander around as a Nomad, gather ressources and be on track all the time but the essence to be progressive in DST is to build yourself a base for all your needs, I mean who wouldn't prefer some delicious Meatballs fresh from the crockpot over berries and carrots.. In order to set up your buildings you can't just immediately cobble together some boards and stones like a pig.. You have to invent them before! By the huge variety of items in the Game it won't be easy to obtain them all. So good luck.  [u]Boss Creatures:[/u] Every now and then some more or less scary Meanies will come to destroy your well deserved progress! Better be prepared and packed with armor, weapons and perhaps some magical items to defeat them. *Psst* They also have unique loot which will grant you access to craft cool gadgets or equipments to make your living easier :)  [u]The Caves:[/u] On the one hand there's the actually quite harmless overworld with its rich land but on the other there's also the underground which has a lot of dangerous and scary beasts lurking for you in the darkness! But if you can prevail down there, you will probably be abled to find the magical secrets of the ruins, which should be discovered by yourself. Once you have beaten them you can rule the overworld with your knowledge!  [h1]Skins (and how to get them)[/h1] Yes, here you'll also find those Skins for Items you might already know from other Games ^^ Don't worry.. they're just cosmetic and won't give you any advantage! Besides the advantage of spicy looking characters, tools or buildings. And you can even share the skins on tools or buildings with your friends in-game, so everyone profits from them ;)  You get 1 Skin Drop everyday by logging in and 8 Skin Drops every week by playing (Caution! Science required) Some might be marketable and some might not be, but they look cool non the less :D You can also purchase Skin Collections in the Shop of the Game to support the Developers!

Be warned though, once you boot up this game, you may never see your family or sunlight ever again.

It's a very helpful mod that acts as a visual HUD for the console.) ------------------------- Here's a list of things you could try doing: You could try your hand at taming beefalo. You could try taking out some of the Giants. You could gather supplies for those who need it. You could explore the caves. You could raid the ruins. You could traverse the Labyrinth. You could kill the Ancient Guardian. You could battle the Marble Chess pieces on a full moon. You could then battle the Shadow Chess Pieces on the new moon. You could then gather 8 fossil fragments and assemble them in the atrium. You could then fight the Ancient Fuelweaver. After that you could go fight Toadstool.

76561198052179245,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason.   If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed.   Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!

76561198101060738,"Don't Starve Together is a top-down survival game of the original Don't Starve, now with multiple mouths to feed with.   You start off by selecting one of the diverse characters from the Wilson Family and are thrown right into the world. Your job is, as the title suggests, to don't starve and survive the upcoming 4 seasonal periods. As from there it goes on, you craft science machines to invent new things, get clothing to fit into the current circumstances and fight off hundreds of hounds, spiders and giants along your way. If you die, there's no other way to be resurrected except a few rare items or the all-famous Telltale Heart, crafted with the blood of other players (literally).  Pros: This game is harsh. It is full of little things that try to kill you or the other way around, limited resources are almost guaranteed, and let's not forget the seasons. You have to prepare for the upcoming season you are about in to enter, which can be a bit tricky sometimes to get used to. Clothing, Hats or items that help you stay cool, warm and dry are crucial.   The gathering of resources and understanding the core on what to do to survive is satisfying to watch. Having your own base set up with all required farms, chests and structures gives a successful feeling to the player and encourages them to repeat said process, to see if they really got the hangout.   Speaking of base building, this is a good game to play with a friend to that has a basic knowledge. A newcomer can learn fairly easily where the rabbit is going and should get the hang of the survival techniques quickly. It may be confusing on what to do first, so it is always recommended to watch what others do, hence said before that it is good to play it with another friend with basic information.   Immense workshop support. This is a big plus for all the mods out there. They can make your life easier, harder or just add some neat little things that really don't change the core too much but help out a ton.   Cons: The lore of this world you are in is briefly explained as ""statues that stand around"". There is no real way to tell how much the game developed in the story without looking it up online. I wished the lore would be given to you at least a bit while playing.   While the world is easy to jump into, the resource placement can be pretty shady at certain parts. I once had one world where thousands of lizards spawned in the middle of the desert, or one biome wasn't generated at all, even after exploring the entire map for a good solid 10 days.   Seasonal periods last for a long time and aren't something you would play quickly for an hr and then go shut the game off. To get into winter, at least 20 days are set, which are about 2 hours in. It doesn't seem that much but the time can feel stretched out at this point.

Main reason : lots of necessary resources are not reproduceable. For instance, flints and stones in early versions. When you get in the serve afterwards, it's almost impossible to play it.  很多一次性资源烧了就烧了，一个Griefer进来整个服全废了，杀牛烧基地烧猪人村的啥都见过 Once a griefer come in the serve, the serve would face a massive catastrophe. He would burn the big houses, the base, kill the buffalos and dig rabbit holes, burn everyone elses' hard work into ashes easily.  新人在冬天或者夏天进服基本必死。然后新手一死，survival服务器马上就炸了，我理解一个人死降所有人san值是为了让大家有羁绊，但是很多新人一进服到处乱转，死了也不说话，所有人都找不到他，大家san值一起疯狂的掉，这使得很多吃san值的角色根本没法用（机器人，图书管理员） If you come in the serve in winter/summer, you are a dead wilson. Once a player dead it would not be a good situation for anyone else in the survival serves. I know the aim of sanity loss for death is to tied up all the members, but there always be someone likes to play alone and once he/she's dead, no one could find him and would suffer a long time.(Usually I quit in this circumstances.) It also cause many characters who have got low sanity rarely seen in the serve, like WX78 and librarian.  这造成服务器的新人友好度低，因为新人很大程度上基本上和破坏者Griefer没什么差别. At last most serves are not welcome the new players and give them little help, cuz unexperienced new players have small differences with griefers.  我很喜欢这游戏，希望能在多人服务器的可持续性上多一些改进。这样才能“一起繁荣”. I love this game very much and I hope in the near future the game would improve in sustainable issues in order to Thrive Together.  ",1458387770,True

76561198055278545,"You kick your feet up peacefully. The roaring fire glistens in your eyeballs, and a warmth encompasses you. Not only physically, but mentally. You've made it through the hard part, after all- right? Those silly spiders and frogs couldn't keep you down! Then you hear it, feintly echoing over the empty plains: barking. ""What's that?"" you think, worrying. You've faced wolves before, killed them even. But these seem...different. As you reach for the spear to your side, you hear the beating footsteps of the pack, drumming their way up towards the light. You tighten your grip around the spear- you are prepared.  Except you really weren't! Dogs jump from all angles towards you, salivating, hungering, desperate for a bite. You slash and spin, killing a few as you go. But...there's a different one. A red one! It runs over, and in a second, one single moment, everything is set ablaze. You watch as your chests, farms, machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time. In your shock and awe, the red dog takes you in his jaws, ferrying you into the darkness. Your body, being devoured, simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash.  ================== A new day... a new chance?  You push through the first 29 days in this hell. You've made quite the home for yourself! And look at that! Not even the fire-dogs could stop you now! ""Another victory!"" you yell, as your friends lift their meatballs in the air for you all. You revel in the moonlight, basking in the greatness that you're all responsible for. A bird cage? Farms? Bushes? Fridges?? You're advanced now! You're self-sufficient! Proud survivors! Everything is brilliant! Not even the biting cold of winter can stomp the burning passion you're all feeling.  But then, as you sit to enjoy a moments peace, the serenity is disturbed. A tremor. A single shake in the ground, followed by a monstrous roar. The team pause, confused. Suddenly, before you know it, another is unleashed. You all look to eachother for answers, but no answers can help now. In the corner of your eye, you see it. Reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire, there is an iris, floating high above the ground. Another tremor rattles the team, and the body of the creature is exposed. A single eye, antlers, a fur coat, and the will to destroy. Time slows down.  You observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature, as it swipes the ground, eviscerating them. Your friends fall to the floor, lascerated with gaping wounds. Blood shoots from their oozing injuries, and the creature laughs, turning its attention to your happiness, your creation. It stomps on the bird cages, uproots the farms, and defecates on your berry bushes, before crushing them inbetween its hand. As the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers, it's eyeball finds its way to you. It stares at you, dropping the pooey bushes. You close your eyes, drop your clothing, and assume the necessary position for what is to follow.  You don't quite survive that winter.  ",1446512789,True

76561198103591851,"Don't starve together Review. Intro Don't starve together is a online game of don't starve written in LUA code developed by klei entertainment. As I have spent well over 580 hours playing the game, hosting dedicated servers, making mods, playing though-out early access and after release I will tell you what I think of the game that ate up most of my free time.  Pros 1 The game is stable, functional and works well just like don't starve does but only online. The game has a massively active fanbase and after I wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages I have been sent to help people on their server, to help get mods working and to join people in there server. The game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag, but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well. I have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me, running 20-40 mods with many people on a server.   2 The game is modable it runs on  the same code as don't starve on LUA code so if you know how to read basic code, and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game. I have been able to make mods for don't starve and don't starve together although I only published them privately. The game is very easy to mod, hell even someone as shit at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made, crappy, interesting, fun and awful mods you can enjoy. You could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore, or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the don't starve together workshop has.   3 The game is really fun I don't need to say that when I spent over 580 hours in the game do I? Well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content. The combat in the game I would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright. Cons  1  The game made me read and write code. I didn't need to and I didn't want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so I could log out of my own game then rejoin it when I came back. Then I learned stuff like how to write ini files, LUA, batch files, and other codey words I can't remember. That stuff isn't fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game. If you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff.    2 The game doesn't have local multiplayer its possible I even say a don't starve mod have local multiplayer so why didn't they add that into DST? Well I can think of why they didn't they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and that's fine. It still sucks that I can't play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever.  WARNING this game is going to mess with you, first you join a few games then your like ""oh I liked this in this game but I didn't like this in, this game"" then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse. Second, You will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 30-80 mods you can enable or disable in your game. then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods, then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer, then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast, well and you will build a awesome base with other players, have lots of fun but then because PVP is off and the game is public, the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made. You can't kick the scum fast enough and you don't just want to kick them... No you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it. So then you turn PVP on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you. Then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies. Warning this game will change you.   Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, yeah its alright. ",1475628379,True

First at all, It's an open world game.In the game the protaganist is trapped in an island, you must explore,collect things,learn,fight, and craft to survive there.But how to survive depends on player's choices.So this island is a mini world.You'll do all things there by your will and choices.That's what attracts me most.I like this kind of games,such as Mount&Blade which I have played for 5 years.  Don't starve's art style is also awesome which will make you remember of Tim Burton's movies.and I really love its adorable character design.  It will be challenging at beginning.You will die for many times for many kinds of reasons.You will learn things from every failure.until you've learned enough skills to survive for really long time, you won't feel hungry any more,but you will feel lonely.as you are the only person in that world(only in Don't Starve). ---------------------------------------------------------------- and good thing is,you won't feel lonely anymore,you can play with your friends now.You need to divide the work and cooperate.That may be more interesting than working alone. You can also make new friends by this game.I met a friendly Korean kid.She(He?) played really well and  helped me generously.We talked by translation software.But I can't play with her anymore because of the bad network.",1506506170,True
76561198255074025,"Stunning art style and unique gameplay. I never like playing survival game because I'm not very good at surviving but this one is different.   This game is just like any other survival games, throwing the player into a world without any instructions but I felt that every deaths is a learning curve that the players learned as they go unlike other games dying from the same thing and never learn anything. Plus not most survival games are third person orientated.   Just like other games, this game also really push you to your limits such as testing your ability, skill, resource spending and time management. You will need to be strategic when you're playing in a harsh world this game puts you in. Planning ahead and praticing in game combat skills if you're one of those hardcore players. Oh yea, there is also PvP for those sociopathy people who killed people for fun.   If you're like me who prefer calm and relaxing gameplay you could play on endless where you are not punished too hard if you died but still keeping survival game vibe.  In the end, I would recommend if you like strategy games, this one would be the one for you. Just before you play I would highly suggest that you go watch some videos and reading wiki before you start playing unless you're like me, entering a gunfight with a knife.",1501344101,True

76561198417658365,"Famine is one of the few games that makes me scratch my head. It provides many wonderful scenes of death, but to see these unforgettable moments, you need to spend a considerable amount of time each time working hard. In this game, you can spend hours collecting resources, equipping characters, fortifying bases, and ultimately just seeing your little paradise destroyed by an unstoppable group of shadow monsters. The game itself is to explore the risk of survival type, death is inevitable, and when you die, the game is really over. Famine doesn't treat players tenderly, which is the reason why I love and hate it.Klei studio adopted the production concept of My World, throwing players into the magnificent wilderness, how to survive is the player's own to understand. Some adventure gamers like this kind of white paper freedom very much. They can play a day with their patience, creativity and courage. But the lack of any guidance and mission goals in this work will allow you to find ways to survive in the world of Tim Burton's film style, and the Gothic style of painting will make you feel that your life is at stake. Simple stories, novel menus, children's literature atmosphere give people a very strange feeling, but the background music is very happy, and repeated brainwashing, soon let the author have to turn off the game music, play the music list of horrible weird atmosphere.The rules of the game are simple: explore the world, collect materials during the day, light a fire at night, eat, repeat. Although this routine has begun to be a bit vulgar, the hopeless struggle for survival brought about by the game is very strong. In a game process, the author found that the food was almost eaten, and was chased by a group of spiders running in the woods, the author felt that there was no hope, so he broke the kettle and sank the boat, facing the wind, set a tree on fire, soon, the whole forest was on fire, the spiders chasing me were also baked into silk, and then I used it. These silks make a dress.After a while, my character was exhausted and I lost my sense, when I was weak and let a little frog attack me, and eventually died under the frog's mouth. I died peacefully - I could have made some high-tech weapons, but I had lived enough to stay in the world of Famine. No achievements, no scores, only their own stories. Game experience is a reward for players.There are often unfair deaths in the game. There have been several times when the straw was in front of me, but in the end it was not available. Although the side view fully demonstrates the excellent artistic concepts of the game, it often blockades the key items painfully. The characteristic of the forest is that there are many trees here, but often encounter the angle of egg pain. You can never find something hidden behind the tree. When your life value is very low and you are chased by all kinds of creatures, a tree often decides your life and death. After death, it's at least another 30 minutes.The only way to break this cycle of life and death is through the doors scattered around the world, which can deliver you to small adventure missions. Usually the task is to have you look for something with a stick, and a group of monsters will try to eat you. These small tasks complement the plot, but once completed, the player returns to the crisis-ridden world, and still has no sense of accomplishment.Before I start a new game, I hesitate because the first 30 minutes or so of each new adventure are extremely boring and are absolutely repetitive and redundant. Indeed, every time I restart, I explore more recipes for making objects, or the behavioral characteristics of certain creatures, but my character not only loses all objects, but also all memories, and will not make advanced objects. I had to re-teach him all kinds of skills, which reminded me of Tetris, which had to endure a long start in order to experience the final frantic extreme escape.The beginning of Famine needs to be improved. You can add more random events, or multiplayer games, or different character skills. It's important to make death in Famine a loss of game progress, not a half-hour accumulation of boredom. Klei has promised to release large-scale updates within six months, and I am looking forward to their new content and hope that they can correct their existing problems.",1543551328,True

76561198154425534,"Don't Starve Together is one of those games where you can have fun no matter how many people because it itself, was originally a singleplayer experience. I have barely scratched the surface of the game, so take my review more as a ramble than an proper review, and while I could write most of this on the standard Don't Starve page, I've had more time on this game than standard DS.  First off, the art design. A lot of people say that the game's artstyle is very Tim Burton-esque, and I can wholeheartedly agree on that, but the inclusion of the Telltale heart item and many other things has also lead me to believe that this game and it's art direction was also inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, as the Tell Tale Heart was a story written by him, and Wilsons examination line ""The beating of this hideous heart will bring a ghost back to life!"" is a direct refrence to the story as well, giving me more proof that Poe's works of literature was a good inspiration to the game. I am a fan of the art style, it looks great, and that's all I really need to say.  Next up, the gameplay. which I am splitting up into two parts; the controls, and the general gameplay( characters and such). The controls feel nice, I prefer using keyboard and mouse instead of solely the keyboard or mouse, as both individually have their downsides. For the keyboard, using WASD is better than clicking, you can stop moving right when you need to, but the downside to the keyboard is when you try and do an action such as attacking or using the crafting menu, it's harder to control in my opinion, while the mouse handles both actions better. Despite all of that, I stil enjoy how it controls. But things such as attacking from a distance or force attacking can be a bit off at times. When I found a Varg at the end of a path, I tried to use a sleep dart on it, but instead of instantly shooting the dart, my character kept moving, to the point where I got the Varg aggroed onto me. There have also been countless times where I try to kill a Pigman or Batilisk near a sinkhole, but I keep breaking the walls around it down because force attack. But both of those are minor nitpicks and it doesn't matter in the long run, but to be honest hounds are just awful.  The characters are pretty well balanced, they each have their advantages and disadvantages, except for Wilson and Winona whom I both despise with no end. The two characters I mainly play as, Wendy and Maxwell, have good advantages, such as having Abigail or Shadow Puppets, but those advantages also have disadvantages, such as less damage dealt or being one of the most fragile characters in the game, which is why I hate characters such as Wilson or Winona, they have no real weaknesses, which makes them an easy pick for newers or less experienced players. Playing together is tons of fun if you and your teammates actually know what they're doing. I sometimes play with people I talk to regularly ([u] it would be really nice if my friends would actually respond to me on Discord but whatever.[/u]), or I just log onto public servers and try to survive without voice, but all-in-all, multiplayer is really fun.  [spoiler] But sometimes my connection to Klei's servers are so bad I get kicked from my own world [/spoiler]  And the last topic is price. This game is $14.99, which is also the price of standard Don't Starve, but one of the best part about the price is that you also get a free second copy of the game that you can send to friend, making this game a relative bargain for anyone who's on the fence about the game. It's even better, in my opinion, if you buy the Mega Pack, which saves you about the price of another copy of DST for everything related to Don't Starve except the soundtrack, which by the way, is pretty good. I've had a great time with the game so far, and it's been the only game I've played in the past few weeks, and I don't think that's going to change.  For a rating, I'll give it a 8.5/10, but if you want play Don't Starve Together without anyone, you could play DST by yourself, or you could just get the normal game, which costs more with RoG, but hey, you can also get Shipwrecked, and Hamlet is coming soon.

76561198072130676,"Don't Starve or Die Tryin’  Klei presents multiplayer spinoff of their “Don't Starve” franchise with everything you could expect: stylish artwork, abundance of weird fauna, frantic gameplay. If you are up to surviving simulators and have a few friends to join you on this quest - don’t bother reading further, just get Don't Starve Together instantly.   Most of issues I have with the game are rather personal and won’t be relevant if I could “git gud”. DST is really fast paced and keeps you from doing anything other than playing during whole session. So basically, I had to start with empty bladder and all the snacks and drinks beside me. Feels more like “Stay hydrated while playing”. This kind of approach is totally not my cup of tea. Also, game has some harsh start for beginners, because there is no any in-game tutorial, manual or anything to teach you basics - all is your tries-n-errors.   Art direction is what distinguishes DST from other survival sandboxes. Colorful and diverse world, with no “default” creatures or characters. Play more and you will see more “burtonesque” creations of game designers. Rich playable character roster gives you distinct experience in every playthrough, with char’s unique pros and cons.   What gives game a huge bonus - active modding community. Thanks to the workshop, you can customize your game in almost any way, or even make you game easier and friendlier to beginners: add minimap, display recipes and effects items have, or even “character pause” to have some break. Mechanically everything is quite simple and convenient to get right into playing: controls are intuitive, creating server is not harder than installing game in Steam, same goes with installing mods.   I totally recommend DST: it’s basically endless game with tons of possibilities, actively supported by developers and community. Good way to start was suggested by my good friend: just watch fourteen hours of “How to…” videos on youtube, and you are ready to starve and die.   ",1529833160,True

76561198006838480,"Very enjoyable experience overall, one of the few games that I would show to people and not feel bad for doing so.  Art style heavily influenced from Burtonland. Developers actually care about their community and talk with them as well as actively fix bugs from their bug reporter. Monster AI is predictable and combat is pretty one dimensional, like Dark Souls but with less choices on weapon behaviours.  Game won't hold your hand when playing, so discovery is half the battle. That being said for someone who knows what they're doing the game currently has little to offer, and it is easy to be ""unkillable"" in less than 20 in-game days- the state where the player is prepared for anything that is thrown at them.  Through the Ages content should give more ""end-game"" activities, but it is not here yet as of this review.  The game can be compared to building a card house or sand castle. It is easy to do once you've mastered the skills, but it is just as easy to make a mistake and watch it all crumble.  Update: Because Steam Awards demand it.  Klei has continued to show support for this title over time and still talks to their users on their forums.

Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!  Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge!   Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!  The game is smooth, no bugs (that i have found currently) and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something.

Almost 99% of the time i join to a new server, more than half the world is already burnt.  in general, a little status about the world before joining in would be nice... as for the pyromaniacs, not sure what can be done, but sure are annoying.

76561198044189299,"The base game is solid, no bugs or problems when me and my boyfriend played, however so far the game is simply different versions of survival mode.   Adventure mode doesn't exist in the game and thus there is no challenge other than surviving as long as you can which, while fun for a few runs, is entirely boring once you hit the plateau of having everything and surviving is no longer a challenge. This is a game with no real end goal or reward, currently.    Original Don't Starve along with the expansions is worth your money more (at this point) if you want a truly fun Don't Starve experience reason to move forward and greater challenges.  You may be able to play with a friend, (which is excellently done I can't stress enough) but with nothing to do but live on forever what's the point in continuous play? However, this is still early access, and hopefully their expansion (to come Spring 2015) will give more reason to play together, as well as encompassing all their other expansions into it as well.   Other than that, hosting and joining servers is flawless. The worlds are exactly the same as Original Don't Starve, with some things from other expansions and new never before seen events and creatures too. It's solid as a whole, but if you're looking for something to play more than once, wait a little longer until they add more to it.

Don't starve together has some features that the original game doesn't but I heard that the developers are working on changing that. Dst is a fun game to play if you want to build up a base with friends or with some people who decides to join your world, if you make it public. I've had plenty of games where I helped fight deerclops with some strangers or had to revive my whole team after a failed boss battle or a hound wave. The game has it's ups and downs but there's more ups than downs. Sure, sometimes there is a grief or your base bursting into flames during summer, but that's all part of the experience.   I can rant on and on about how great the game is but there is a big downside to it if you're not used to games like it. You put in a lot of time and effort into your worlds. To running around grabbing grass and twigs, to building up your base and making farms, to surviving hound attacks, and to dealing with seasonal bosses that can destroy an unprepared person with ease. The game runs on a high risk, high reward style and boy, there's a lot of risks. If you're not the type of person who likes to put in a lot of effort and time into a game or you get bored easily, then this game isn't for you.  Sometimes a single mistake by a teammate or yourself can take away all of that progress you made.  Please, look at the game before you spend money on it. Don't get it if your friend is playing it and you just want to fit in. Buy it if you're going to play it with your friends, by yourself, and with random people in servers. I have a friend who bought it just because I play it and only put in a few hours into it before getting bored of it. Don't be a Chris. (Sorry Chris if you somehow read this.

In my opinion, ever since I played Don't Starve in alpha state on Google Chrome, I felt like it would be a fantastic co-op or even versus experience and the steam numbers don't lie, everyone loves Don't Starve Together!  Every character is unique and those specialties are even more colorful in multiplayer as you can take on different roles that you are suited for in your co-op or group play.   If you enjoyed Minecrafts vanilla survival experience but now want a much deeper and more challenging adventure, take the leap and jump into the world of DST!  Note: from here on out (since launch) the base game and Don't Starve Together will have diverging content updates which means that there will be content not included from the base game and vice versa.  Note: in the description it is called ""expansion"" but it is entirely a seperate game, you don't need the original game to play this.   Note: for multiplayer it says (Co-Op) but you can't share screens and you need 2 versions of the game.  Note: game uses Steam Workshop, so you can download tons of mods and that includes some modded in characters from the original game's new expansion ""ShipWrecked"".

76561198202848659,"Don't Starve Together is possibly the best multiplayer game I have ever played. Nay, possibly the best game, period.  When I first started playing, I could barely survive on my own. I was in constant fear of starving to death, going insane, and running for my life from bloodthirsty packs of hounds. I was dying a lot and most of the time it was my own fault. I kept playing though because with each death I learned a little more about how to better survive the next world.  The best part of this game has to be the friendly community. I always love joining a random server and being greeted with a friendly ""hello"" usually followed by directions to a base. I learned most of my Don't Starve skills from more experienced players who offered their help and advice. Now I happily do the same thing for new players. It's a great feeling knowing that people are enjoying the game more because of me.  If you ever get bored of the normal gameplay there are also tons of great mods on the steam workshop. Not to mention that this is still getting updates to the vanilla game. This game already has so much fun content in my opinion but the fact that it's still being updated is amazing. I'd like to thank the devs for making this awesome game and for their continued support of it.  What, you still haven't decided if you should get this game?

If they requested anything other than meatballs, I'd tell them the alternative was wet goop, so they accepted it and moved on, enjoying my balls of meaty goodness.   My secret recipe was the most guarded thing in the server, and I would be paid in large quantites of gold nuggets for my juicy balls of goodness. Everything was happy and good, until a curious Webber snuck into my crock pot facility when I was busy burning down a forest and enjoying the screams of innocent rabbits.  The Webber soon figured out my ultimate meatball recipe: 3 pieces of ice and a rotten morsel.  As he tried to run out my base and expose my delicious massive balls, a boomerang smacked him across the head, knocking him out. I don't know who threw the boomerang, and I don't know where he's gone. It truly is a tragedy, and everyone mourned over his loss.

76561198066905165,"I must be one of the only few people who is not enthusiastic about Don't Starve. I definitely recognise it has a lot of qualities. Nice hand-drawn graphics, a real universe of its own with funny characters and monsters and a lot of imagination. The concept itself is original: a mixture of craft and survival with a strong emphasis on the survival part, rather than on the building part. And you can play it multiplayer, that's great !  So why the thumb down ? Well in this kind of game, the aspect I usually like is the building part. You farm, you collect, you build, and you let your own imagination decide how your camp is going to look like, what gears you're gonna craft to go hunting, etc. However, the very core of the game is the constant pressure that you have little time to gather food, handle your health, mental health and hunger at the same time, and still build the things that are necessary to survive the winter and the monsters. Consequently, the creative part is totally overshadowed by the need to survive (at least for low-level players like me).   Furthermore,  the game, from its title to the essence of its gameplay, cynically pushes you to see how long you can survive, because you'll eventually die, it is just a matter of when and how. And surviving is merely rewarded by your score, i.e., the number of days you spend before dying. The worst part for me is the absence of Steam achievement to motivate me to try and try again. I die ? Well I can launch a new game, but maybe just to die a little later, which means at best discovering a few more mobs or objects and... that's it. Well, sorry guys but that can't keep me motivated.  Not a bad game by any mean, but not oriented towards creativity, and not rewarding enough for me.",1552333246,False

76561198052586802,"My review about this game was originally a silly joke in the form of a satirical in-game scenario, but I feel like I really need to do it some justice. Don't Starve Together, ideally, is just that: Don't Starve, but Together, with other people, normally with your friends since public servers are admittedly going to generally be pretty toxic. However, it is still perfectly playable solo, and there's so much more to the game than just being a multiplayer version of its predecessor. The team behind it seems genuinely passionate about what they're doing, so much so that some of it even rubs off on the workshop and the creators of a lot of the mods in it. They even gave Don't Starve Together away to owners of Don't Starve for FREE back when it was still in the beginning of its early access stage, and INCLUDED all the DLC they had for the latter game at the time.  To start, if you don't know what Don't Starve (Together) is, it's probably one of the oldest, truest, and all-around best survival sandbox games out there. It has a unique artstyle, some interesting lore, and easy-to-learn but still always threatening and challenging gameplay. After hundreds of hours, I'm still learning and being amazed, or, at the very least, intrigued by a lot of the things I still don't know about that I accidentally stumble upon while playing. It's truly a new experience every time. It also doesn't have the problem almost every ""survival game"" out there has nowadays, too, with being very one-dimensional, predictable, or feeling just like one of those dime-a-dozen copies of popular representatives of the genre. There's so much you can customize for each individual world, both the good and the bad, the objects and the mechanics, it's just overall very customizeable, which is always a welcome feature, especially to the picky folk or perhaps the type who easily get bored of games with one or very few different settings, and that's not even mentioning the mods.  Oh gosh yes, the workshop. It's absolutely wonderful. Although a lot of people can agree that making and maintaining mods for the game can be very difficult and ""time consuming and a mess of coding"" in the game's current stage, the level of activity and additional customization that can be found in the workshop is amazing and provides virtually unlimited replayability to the game.  Honestly, to any modders reading this who still support their mods, I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm genuinely thankful for what you're doing. You make the community and the game even more awesome than it already is, and it wouldn't quite be what it is without all of your contributions. Unless all you do is make reskinned Wilsons of anime, pony, or FNaF characters with nothing more than a buff to the base character stats. Seriously, cut that out. It's embarrassing for everyone.  This is also the only game I know of with an in-game market worthy of mentioning without some stupid desperate attempt to grab your cash for every box you want to open. You get free boxes of cosmetic items for your characters just by playing, and can also open them... for free! And you can even buy and sell them on the Steam market, and recycle them with a function in game.  Seriously, I can't think of any downsides with this game--even if I could, the good most certainly outweighs the bad--and it's tough to imagine Klei bailing out on development and letting us down. So why haven't you gotten this game yet? The devs deserve your support and you deserve to give yourself a quality time killer!",1486956737,True

I'll keep it kind of short for this one, as I'm sure I'll have to update it many times in the future as Klei decides to host more events and push out more content for this game.   As you can see, I've spent a lot of time in this game, and truly it feels like barely any time at all. Time passes at supersonic speed when playing this game with a good group of buddies, and it's honestly impossible to not make friends while playing this. Every single friend on my steam list is someone I either met from this game or someone I made buy the game and play it with me.   This game is grindy and never ending, there are seasonal events every year with new content to explore and new cosmetic drops to collect. There are also random events that change the game entirely, one being a crazy ranked nonstop battling competition that even had people screaming about nerfs and metas and yelling at each other as if we were playing League. The other random event that recently took place was similar to an Overcooked style of gameplay and was very hectic and fun. There is also random puzzles that are released and involve team work to unlock special skin prizes.   I've been pretty active in the forums for this game and have watched many, many streams or YT videos of it, as well as playing in every event. So I definitely have a good grasp on this one.   This is a surivial game that allows you to spend all your time exploring, farming, battling bosses or dungeon crawling the caves. There is a lot going on in this one, and I have tried to find many games ""similar to Don't Starve Together"" and none compare. There is just something about how this game will literally allow you to do anything or play to any style and look so nice artwork wise as well, that just can't be compared in other surivial games.   TONS of lore that is constantly being expanded on and explained, a huge world with options to increase or decrease any aspect of it, including difficulty. Can play with any number of friends, and while people tend to talk about a difficulty curve in this game, I really do not think this is that hard and anyone can learn to play it and ""not starve"". Though dying to random BS is probably more likely than starving....   The workshop makes this game never boring as it allows creativity to flow to the max. I've played TF2 battle royale type games with some friends, and been in servers that were practically VRChat level of roleplaying and BS. You can make this more like Animal Crossing if you want, or more like a horror game, or more like a PVP game. Literally anything you want this game to be or any character you want in it, the workshop will have it. This game can't be recommended enough and can fit anybody expectations.

Также, как и в любой другой игре, нам предоставляется возможность скачать несколько интересных модов, созданных самими игроками.   В этот раз, разработчики нас удивили тем, что добавили возможность кооператива. Теперь, можно играть не только одному, но и с друзьями! ;) Это придают большей интриги и интереса. Выживать вместе намного проще, чем одному, ведь так? Я считаю, что эта возможность безоговорочно занимает одно из важных мест по меркам в играх.

When i play this beautifully crafted game, i feel like i am wondering about a Tim Burton film. It's a welcome change from the normal survival game interface and artwork, much like its' sister product ""dont starve"".  Second, the way you evolve with your character. At first glance, you seem like a cave man who just woke up and needs to eat, but when you find some berries and get fed, you instantly start scrounging around for grass, twigs and flint. You make an axe and start to collect wood logs. OH NO IT'S NIGHT TIME WE GON DIEEEEE. You now have to make a fire. All of these simple beginners steps turn your caveperson like sprite, into a brave warrior who fights wolves from hell, living trees, and a huge deer with one eye whos one wish in life is to crush you and your friends hard work (and or skulls).  Finally, whatever else is good about ""dont starve"", its twice as good in this game.   ""why?""

76561198078352845,"One of my Sperglord friends told me that I wrote ""butterflies"" incorrectly on the previous version of this review. So this review just turned into a grammar lesson about the plural form of nouns that end with ""y"".  [b] Ahem... [/b]  How do you form the plural of a proper noun that ends in y such as Murphy? Should you change the name to Murphies? Given how other English words ending in y form their plurals, you would think so. Examples: puppy / puppies army / armies supply / supplies  However, proper nouns are not pluralized the same way common nouns are. Rule: Do not change the spelling of a name to make it plural. Instead, just add s. Examples: I visited the Murphys last weekend. We have two Zacharys in our office.  What if you want to show possession with a name that ends in y? Rule: To show singular possession, use the apostrophe and then the s. Example: I petted Mrs. Murphy’s cat.  Rule: To show plural possession, make the proper noun plural first, then use the apostrophe. Examples: I petted the Murphys’ cat. I visited the Murphys’ store on Main Street.  Rule: To show the plural of a name that ends in s, ch, or z, add es. Examples: The Sanchezes will be over soon. The Thomases moved away.   Hope you're fucking happy.",1427405031,True
76561198012105681,"Original Don't Starve always left me with an odd and uncomfortable feeling of loneliness. It may be considered a part of the atmosphere - your character is stranded in a hostile environment, after all. But still, it became tiresome after some time.  Now, you can invite a friend to share the game world. Delegate tasks, feed each other, support your companion in battle with nature and elements, or suddenly leave your friend to be devoured by hounds while you escape! Instant fun! It's a bit tough that you can't pause the game, though. Don't starve is a time-consuming game, and when you play in company, someone is bound to be distracted from the game at some point.

76561198009474997,"Don't Starve Together Review  Not just another expansion, but a fully standalone multiplayer version of the game we have come to love and hate with the same heart.  Some key points that this game add on has to offer:  1.	Fully standalone multiplayer game. 2.	Co-op survival or PVP. 3.	Create your own local, private or open server for up to 6 players. 4.	The Gorge Event to offer a reason to always want to come back. 5.	Everything we have in Don’t Starve we almost have here but now we get to enjoy it with friends.  Replayability:  It goes without saying that this game requires replays so we won’t go into it here, it is a requirement by now, Don’t starve until you do, then you die and get XP based on how long you survived, XP unlocks new characters for you to try out.   MGRza’s Conclusions:  This game isn’t just another expansion but gives us a brand new game in multiplayer so that we can play with friends or new comers in the same world we have come to know, Don’t Starve together also includes Reign of Giants; adding new characters, seasons, creatures, biomes, and giant new challenges for you to undertake either solo or with a couple of friends. You can start the game by either selecting a random server from the available list, or joining a server created by mates or go at it by yourself by creating and customizing your own server, setting it up the way you want it, adding extras to it, mods or other add ons from the community and then when you are set you can make it public or private and once you are ready you can start your new journey and see how far you get.

Yell at the moron who put the beeboxes right next to the campfire TOGETHER (Totally wasn't me... even if it was, I never used one beefore) It was also fun to hunt TOGETHER. Trap those trunk animal thingies that I can never spell correctly, TOGETHER. Almost freeze to death TOGETHER. Ditch your friends and hide in a cave whilst they get murdered by hounds and a deerclops on the same night... (Maybe not together) Also fun to rebuild the base TOGETHER. And it was fun to try to avenge our friends TOGETHER. And it was (Maybe not so fun) to lose more friends in trying to avenge our friends, TOGETHER. And then losing tons of sanity to instant rain... Together... And ending our adventure to a frog rain and hound attack at the same time... Together.

Let's start off with the good.  This game is so much fun with friends and a GREAT way to make friends. On average (from my experience) the communty i friendly. It is Don't Starve, after all, so it's a unique gameplay and idea. There's a bunch to do, especially with mods. I've done everything form 1v1 tournaments to just regularly playing/surviving. The game is updated regularly and maintained with a close eye. I love how responsive the creators at Klei are. They love to stay interactive with their fans and fellow gamers. There's an interesting backstory to DST, which branches from DS (Learn about it by playing the CycIum puzzle). I just love this game so much.  Now, for the bad.  There's not much here. There are and always will be bugs, especially when mods are involved. Without Don't Starve background, the game can be a bit dificult, but that shouldn't be a problem with help from the other gamers (assuming your server has other people). That's pretty much it. The game isn't really bad.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who:  A) Likes survival games.  B) Likes games that involve interracting / making friends.  C) Likes a very interesting sketch-like art style.",1463250708,True

76561198012473463,"[h1]Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36214917/]Curator Group for more reviews[/url][/h1]  Don't Starve Together is a multiplayer survival game. If you've played Don't Starve, don't worry, this game is almost identical to Don't Starve, aside from the multiplayer capabilities and a few relatively minor features. Gameplay-wise, Don't Starve translates very well to multiplayer. It's easier to gather food and other resources with 2+ people, but more resources are needed to support the extra people. It manages to balance the game experience very well, without feeling like having extra people is a negative.  Don't Starve Together strikes a great balance between difficulty and accessibility. It is challenging but never gets frustrating or annoying. The rush during the ""easy"" seasons to prepare for winter makes for an enjoyable gameplay loop that is seemingly repetitive, but doesn't get boring thanks to the wide array of possibilities when playing.  The modding community is another strong point of DST. There is a huge variety of characters to play as if you get bored of the base game. There are also quite a few content mods, adding new things to craft, new enemies, new biomes, etc.   Overall, DST is a fantastic game to play with friends and one with a lot of replayability.",1580222888,True

76561198092751351,"Don't Starve Together is not just uncompromising but can also be unforgiving. Do not be misled by it's squiggly graphics as the real meat of the game is elsewhere. It has defined its own niche in the survival genre and has inspired a lot of new games in the process. Given the enormous amount of details that you need to be wary of in order to survive, this could easily be one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play and yet you may not hate it.  This game demands a lot of patience from its players and expects them to learn from their mistakes quickly. This game rewards forethought but unforgivingly punishes carelessness. The quality of your choices will greatly affect your survival process. The players will not just combat callous monsters, eerie darkness, and constant hunger, but also their own stupidity. This game will teach you to turn every lurking danger into opportunity rather than simply generalizing every outcome as either good or bad.  Pros: 1)The Game is rich with endless content that'll keep you curious and entertained. 2)Involves a lot of scouting, gathering of resources and their management, item-crafting, and base-building. You'll also have to deal with hostile monsters and an uncaring climate. 3)Good Teamplay will be a satisfying experience. Conversely, bad  team players will make their uninviting presence felt.  Cons: 1) You may die a lot initially before you get a hang of the game dynamics.  ",1521485357,True

Its the same as the original game but now you can play it with friends and other people. overall its a great game. 9/10,1479369594,True
76561198144736008,"First off,  this game is undeniably good, for his great community, mod support, and hard gameplay. For a dont starve diehard like me it's pretty easy to like this game, since i pratically loved the ""Dont starve single player""  But ill try to get in the shoes of someone that's new to the genre and the game.  -Is it good for a starter? Has it got some replayability?  This game is actually pretty hard at the start, and you need to get the hand of it, so dont ragequit if you die once. But the gameplay is solid and not repetitive, every world is different from eachother, and you can survive pretty much untill you get bored and you want to restart,and belive me, you will not get bored untill the 1000th day. But i reccomand playing a bit alone to get the hang of it hosting your private server.  -Do the servers cost?   ABSOLUTELLY NOT! You can play with your friends wherever you want and whenever you want. It's pretty much like Terraria and Starbound (NOT COMPARATING THESE GAMES WITH DONT STARVE TOGETHER, JUST COMPARING THE SERVER SYSTEM) where you can host your private server and let people join in, but if the hoster crashes/leaves the server, it will be closed. But if you want to evitate that and you have a  big wallet, you can buy a dedicated server and do whatever you want with it, since it's open 24/7  -Is it good to coop with other players? what differenciate this game from the single player standalone edition?  Well, if you want to play a hard survival game with your buddies, this is the game for you,and actually, having coop in dont starve it's not that bad,you can do crazy things with some character combos. This game is pretty good for your pockets and time as well! Since all characters and content for Reign of Giants (Dont starve DLC) is in there and all characters are unlocked, so you dont need to do those crazy things to unlock characters again (im talking to you webber). The game has a lot of new content released in the ""A new reign"" expansion, such as new bosses,new items, and overall a lot of fitting addictions in the game, that the standalone version doesnt benefit of. Another great featuers of Dont Starve Together are the gamemodes, instead of survival (basically you die and lose everything, such as the original ""Dont Starve"")  you can choose a different mode, such as Endless, (you become a ghost when you die and you can revive your buddies with a special item or you can directly go to the portal where you spawned).  Another thing (that i suppose some people aren't a fan of) are the skins for the characters and items, i dont say that is a good or bad thing, but thats based on your personal tastes, i personally like how the skins change the boring look of the normal character to please the eye a bit, but i dont reccomand spending money on them, or at least not too much, you know, it's not Cs:go where you only show off your knives.  -Are mods a bad thing? Do they ruin the overall experience?  It depends, again, based on your personal tastes. If you are bored of the base game, you can just personalize it adding new bosses/characters/items created by this awesome and active mod community,or if you want to just add some graphical/HUD tweaks, client mods exist for that! and you dont need to apply them in your server, so you spare some HDD space for your buddies. Overall, mods are an optional thing, im just here to say that they exist  -I hear a lot about seasonal events, what are they? Are they invasive in some way?  Events are a new thing introduced in Dont Starve Together to keep the game alive (as i think their purpose is). They mostly introduce new items and skins for a limited time (Such as the Chrismas tree and the ""Snowfallen"" skin set for characters) or introduce a new mode for a bit, that gives skins as a reward (Ex: The Forge, an arena survival based coop mode with classes) If you dont like partecipating these events (you are an horrible pearson), you can still enjoy the base game without any problems :D  -I got this game free, why?  Klei gave the game for free to the owners of ""Dont Starve"" before the DST's complete game launch   I am pretty surprised that Klei made such an awesome improvement from the basic Dont starve! Not just like a quick cash grab adding a multyplayer separated feature.

If u have gotten good at it and a bit bored with the game then get some mods in there! Mods are really helpful for beginners, like the No Death Penalty or Extra Equip slots.

If you need help, you can ask for it but I suggest doing your own thing for awhile until you figure out the basics.  Everyone has their own way of doing things - find yours.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I figured I thus might as well tack on a few extras, both to give some info for newer players, and for the Steam badge obviously.   The game itself has quite a well learning curve. At first, you're going to die, you're going to make unfamiliar and useless things. We all start somewhere. Eventually, however, you're going to find a strategy, whether it be ruthless slaughter, or base-sitting farming. Of course, the game doesn't give a break, and constant threats coming from all angles, keeping you on your toes. Both it and its predecessor, Don't Starve, share similarities and differences that make each game the same, yet an entirely different, experience. The game itself is superbly fun, but the only downside I see is that even with the new content additions, server optimization is below average, and even playing with 1 other friend living a state away from me with caves enabled caused the server to chug, and overall be unstable at most times.  TL;DR, good game, good curve, below-average server optimization.",1545326454,True

Recently however i've been permanently banned from the DST community hub just for voicing my opinion about this toxic community.  Let me state this clearly though, as some people have not gotten the memo yet.  [b]IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING THIS WITH [i]FRIENDS[/i] AND ONLY [i]FRIENDS[/i], DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS REVIEW. PLEASE BUY THE GAME, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER[/b]  [h1]#1: Furries[/h1]    These ""people"" upload as much furry content to the workshop as they can. At least 50% of custom characters uploaded the Steam Workshop are these ""fursonas"" or whatnot. These bipolar toddlers are god-damned disturbing as well. I recall once joining a server with said characters and seeing something along ""ohmygodddd it looks so hot XD"" in the chat, no I am not exaggerating. Say anything that these neglected kids have a differentiating opinion on and they'll introduce you to their fast typing skills of ""stfu"" or the classic ""YOU JUST CAN'T APPRECIATE THE FURRY COMMUNITY FAG"". Furthermore, I posted this picture to the community hub:  http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/366zzf (Furries everywhere)     Within half a week I was permanently banned from posting anything to the DST hub. And when I investigated by looking in the page source (They mods never specified why I was banned in the first place, funny) I found that I was banned for ""Offensive content and Spamming"". Neither of which is valid in any way at all. Most of the Furrys had the nerve to go on my profile and report a bunch of my other content. They managed to team up to take down all my Payday 2 posts, one of which had around 1,200 likes and was on the top Steam posts for about a week. To this day, a -year and a half- two years later my privileges are revoked on both hubs. Thanks, assholes.  [h1]#2: Kids[/h1]    I'm fine with kids playing games, i'm going to clear that up right now. But when you have 7-9 year olds playing online, always asking you for ""flint pls"" or spamming ""xD"" in the chat it admittedly gets annoying after awhile. (Thanks the Klei for not adding voice chat I haven't gone completeky insane from these kids.) This is fine however as they usually keep to themselves or just tag along with a friend, but usually this is not the case. Don't expect to come across any kids with respect for you or anyone. They also like to follow you around and steal your loot, that's cool too.  [h1]#3: Griefers[/h1]    Remember that game Minecraft? Well, in that game the multiplayer servers had 'Griefers'. These people would go around and purposely destroy other peoples creations. But in this, these people will play as the character Willow who starts off with a lighter, they will then go around and set everything on fire making most servers unplayable knowing that all the resources have been destroyed. Unless the existing players have some sort of plant and tree seeds stored away, the server becomes unplayable as it has no wood or food. This happens to most servers without some sort of anti-grief feature. Luckily, more servers are adopting new anti grief mods. So this isn't too much to worry about.  [h1]#4: Stupid people in general[/h1]    I'm not saying everyone is, but a good majority of people in the community are. From ingame people asking all the time ""how 2 I get wood?/"", and the community putting useless guides and discussions in the community, it's damn annoying.  To start off, ingame you're most likely to come acroos flat out stupid players. For example, this one time I found a pig village (An uncommon group of buildings that are accompanied by lots of food) I ran about 5 minutes to get to it, and I found a lot of berries enough to last me a few days. I then grab the berries and start walking away. Sooner or later come across the owner of the server and he said to me, (and trust me these were just about his exact words) ""wow you just took my berries"" Banned from the server, why? Because I took ""his"" berries. This was on an open public server. This is an uncommon example, but i feel like this game appeals to ""that"" demographic of kids, y'know? Like the Roblox/Minecraft/Unturned kids. Extrememly toxic and malicious kids.   And the Steam community is much worse. If you go on the DST Community Hub right now, you'll see many Guides and Discussions made by little kids who don't know what the term ""proper english"" means. To be completely honest I could write a book longer than the entite Hunger Games book trilogy complaining about how damned this community is. Take a look for yourself, you'll see what I mean.     There's my rant about why this community is horrible. If you're a decent human being who; doesn't jerk off to animals, you're over 12, nice to people, and has actually had an education. You should pat yourself on the back, god thanks you. But still avoid this game. (I'm guessing everyone's going to flag this for ""offesive content and spam"", right?)

The combination of 2D cartoon-style graphics with a 3D world was a clever idea and makes the game quite light-weight. The Together version is, to my mind, the most enjoyable when playing cooperative. Still, I suggest playing alone, or trying the single player Don't Starve first, for the max experience.  I also have to mention the mysterious analytics system of Klei. The game collects information about you, but it doesn't explain what exactly it is.

Once you realize you can make it to day 50 without much of effort you realize that going around a map and trying to loot different stuff is... yea, pretty useless since you have only one goal.

76561198081023231,"Don't Starve Together is a wonderfully unique multiplayer survival game. The survival mechanics are simple but fun. I can sit down for a while just picking things up on the ground, cutting trees, and exploring the map that's different every world you make, the weather and season even changes. Playing the game with friends is fun and adds more to the survival management of living in the odd world. However new players may be fairly confused with how some of the items crafted or found in the wilf are for and do. Not even I know what some things do exactly, so I suggest pulling up the Don't Starve Wiki to learn what some things do. I think more in-game explanation would've been very nice.  A lot of the giants, the bosses that wonder about or spawn at specific condition, as well as just some of the normal hostile mobs wondering out and about are frustratingly awful to fight, their attacks can stunlock you into taking damage in a huge chain and it's almost impossible to attack without taking damage yourself. One of the first giants you fight during the winter season is Deerclops,  a beefy big creature that spawns sometime in the winter to walk over to you to fight, you'd better not be at your base as it will wreak everything up. The problem with Deerclops is that his main attack is this punch that sends a punch of ice spikes at you, there is no way of attacking him without being hit because there is no way of sprinting away fast enough before your littered with ice. More forgiving combat would be nice.  For people wanting to get into this for a single type thing is not going to have very much luck, the mobs have been rebalanced for more than just one person, giving them more health and damage, making it almost unplayable. However using the Steam Workshop you can download many mods from many different people to make the game a bit easy on you. You can get mods that change the mob health depending on the amount of players in your server and a mod that allows you to pause your game. However I'd just suggest the single player Don't starve as it's more refined for that play style of playing all on your own.  Every week you can get some gift boxes and this resets every Thursday. These gifts contain cosmetic items that you can put on your character, they can even be sold on the community market as well as be traded so if your're into all that it's pretty nice. Speaking of characters, you can pick from many differnt characters with different traits, stats, and unique abilities. It's great to play with all the characters to see how they all work and play.  Overall the game is quite nice, I like the survival stuff in the game, the unique world you discover, the style of how the world is depicted. Despite the somewhat bad combat, lack of explanation of things, the game is really good and I'd suggest anyone who enjoys survival games to try it out. How ever people who want to play single player wither play the normal Don't Starve or go into the Steam Workshop to download some mods to make it a bit easy.",1491677855,True

Figured I should throw it a thumbs up.  The aspects of the game that I feel are worth mentioning: -If you do not have very good internet, the game's difficulty spikes because combat relies heavy on a strong connection. Otherwise, you are forced to deal with lag or just play alone on your own server. -Being good at this game is mostly based on knowledge. If you know how to survive and what does what, survival is rather easy. But there is a lot to see. wear armor lul -Events that are only for limited amounts of time that are inaccessible and apparently do not really profit the creators due to the cost of hosted servers so further reappearances of the Forge and Gorge aren't confirmed even if they are a ton of fun but I think there's a Forge mod -Barebones plot -Just getting through 1 season (which are 15 or 20 days on default settings aka the only true way to play) takes hours  I prefer Together to the singleplayer version because I wasn't a fan of worldhopping which felt like starting a new game but just giving yourself endgame stuff at the beginning of it. Together just has worlds that are meant to last for eternity, everything is renewable that might not be in singleplayer. But singleplayer does have Shipwrecked and Hamlet.

76561198067058252,"[b]PROS:[/b] [b]Rewards combat skills and careful resource management.[/b] Too many survival games either require an impossible ammount of luck or are easily broken with infinite farms: DST offers a fantastic balance of the two. [b]Requires constant adaptation to survive.[/b] Even very far into the game, getting careless can result in a swift death. The game rewards those who plan ahead and is very fair in how it punishes those who dont. [b]Lots of mod support.[/b] The community workshop and klei forums host a plethora of user-generated content, and there are dozens of tutorials for those looking to make their own mods.  [b]CONS:[/b] [b]Steep learning curve.[/b] Knowing how to survive requires players know everything that can happen, when they can happen, and what needs to happen beforehand. This can be especially frustrating for players attempting to join their more experinced friends, as they may make several mistakes and be totally unaware of them. [b]Limited creative options.[/b] If building magnificent structures is your thing, skip this game. Structures are very much function over form, and to create anything asthetically pleasing is very difficult without mod support. [b]No final objective.[/b] Whereas single player had a pseudo-ending in the from of escaping to another island and adventure mode, the only thing players can work towards is killing all of the bosses. For some this isnt an issue, but for others it may be a deal breaker. [b]Online servers require data collection.[/b] For anyone privacy-concious, be aware that Klei limits you to lan servers should you opt out of data collection. This also means you will be unable to equip any cosmetic items you own.

Since they all had minimal hours in the game, they must be noobs. Everybody starts off starving to death, getting killed by things etc. If you just take the time to learn how to survive it will be a far better experience. You will not only survive, but thrive. For instance, I was terrible at the game to start so I died a lot. Now I can solo kill Dragonfly and the other giants without much issue, clear the ruins with ease, and I often have too much food.

With simple controls and a simple concept (don't starve), you will be constantly thrown into harsh unpredictable situations in which every decision will directly impact whether you survive or die the another day. A great game to play with friends cooperatively which will test your chemistry to the limits.   I absolutely adore the artstyle & soundtracks. The atmosphere and soundscape never fail to create a warm fuzzy (yet dark and macabre) feeling as you play. This being said, it is an inherently ""grind"" heavy game and most of your time will be spent performing repetitive tasks (or dying).

76561198094323685,"With its unique artwork and mechanics this game deserves a good old 10/10.    Whatever you like survival games or not its a 'must play'. It is here for years now and it has become one of the most liked survival games so there re lots of gameplay videos and trailers you can check before buying. But like i mentioned its a must have and its really cheap for its worth.  pros: - endless gameplay with lots of content. - awsome graphics, sounds/musics. - very colorfull and changing with all the biomes, seasons, day-night cycles and even with random maps which has to be like a copy of each other but nope they re not. - even tough its a sandbox survival it has a very good story mod which is implented in sandbox play. i consider it a pro cos first of all you can play both sandbox and story mod in one save with same character without ruining or effecting each other. starting the story mode is even better. you dont just click a button but complete some task which re not given but to be solved as you play. not givin more info as it will be spoiler. - simple to play hard to survive meaning you can play with your family or moto gang. - runs smooth even on low spec laptops with all that shinny graphics thanks to easy to render artwork models. - bug free! yes never noticed any bugs. well maybe there is some but not even noticed so gues its more than enough. - for controller types this is one of the rare games that i consider gamepad is better. good support and even if you re not familiar with a controller you can easily get used to it while playing dont starve in minutes. well its a must if you ask me. - very active developers. every month/year i expect them to leave the game alone as its ok already but now they come up with even more content. - very active workshop. lots of mods new characters etc. - CHEAP for this kind of game and developing/support. really they deserve more for sure. - even if you say im done with this game (well yea after a year or something you dont wanna spend like 5 hours playing same game) you cant get rid of all those artwork, musics and all kind of stuff about this game. it suddenly becomes something like a childhood memory that you cant forget. just like a cartoon character or something.   well cant think of a con but maybe some can say its a bit repeating but to say that you need to spend at least dunno 3-4 months playing. also 1 out of 20 people hates this game just in very first mins of gameplay for no reason. dunno why maybe the artwork but yea thats the fact :D  so if you want to add another game to your favorites of all time list just go for it.

Oh and I hope you had collected ice or you will die from overheating.  Straw hats only do so much to keep you cool.  But that's not the end of it, nope.

76561198011399656,"A challenging yet enjoyable survival wilderness game. Servers are extremely customizable and you can pretty much add as many mods as you want. If you really want to use it, there even is a cheat console in-game. The characters are also diverse in their skill sets, difficulty level, and personalities.   You also receive a free copy of DST when you purchase it, so you can gift it to a friend.  Microtransactions are mainly limited to cosmetics - even then, you can get a lot of them for free in-game (though randomly). The MTs are also unintrustive, they won't nag you to purchase resources/boosters/etc...unlike some other games. Massive updates and new content are also free as well!    ------------ EDIT ------------  However, I do want to point out there are special characters you can buy with real money, but they are also craftable using (an absurd amount of) spools. Some you receive for ""free"" in DST if you buy the associated DLC for Don't Starve (single player). I feel somewhat conflicted about this because I don't want to see Klei adopting some of the nastier aspects of the game industry's business models (looking at you, EA).  - For some players, this is a time or money gate-lock.  - Spools are obtained via unraveling undesired cosmetics. - Spools gained are based on the cosmetic's quality.  - Cosmetics are gained randomly, with no set time rate* - *Cosmetics are given as daily log in rewards. It's a guaranteed reward, but definitely feeds into a sense of addiction (i.e. ""Don't miss the daily log in item!"")  As of this review, DST has a base price of $14.99. It's not a $60 game that microtransactions the living daylights out of its playerbase, but it's always good to be wary of such changes.

76561198013645715,"First of all, this game is close to my heart for it's style, all quirky, like a 90s Tim Burton movie, with great characters, different quotes and interactions for each one, so there's a lot of replayability just in that.   As a multiplayer game that keeps the challenging aspects of the original but understood that it would need a lot more, you'll find a lot of stuff to do here, even if you didn't like Don't Starve (alone? lol) at first. You can keep the difficulty and try to go as far as you can with your friends, but you could also mess around with the settings, make it easier to survive and just have fun, there's even a ton of mods made by the community that could change almost any aspect of the game that could make it frustrating for any type of player, so I could recommend this game to anyone.   Now, about the challenge, which is my favorite part of this game...   You have to spend some hours on it, it's totally time based, which means that as the time goes by, you get hungry and have to gather enough resources to eat (well, it's called Don't Starve), make it through the night, survive random events, defeat or get away from strong enemies that show up around you... And then, you find something you've never seen before or falls to an unexpected effect, it kills everyone, and you have to restart the map. Just to be clear, you can use the settings to make the game easier to try again or even never lose your progress, but learning after dying and trying over and over again is the core experience of this game for me, and by the way, starting a new map, wondering what you'll find - since it's a different map every time- and how far you'll make it this time is incredbly fun.   And if you're already convinced to play it and would like a piece of advice from me, don't look up stuff on the internet. As I said, learning through failure is a core aspect of the game, it's still fun -and hard- if you know about everything, but some of my best experiences happened when I was learning from friends and overcoming challenges by discovering something new through trial and error.  As of now, I've never got to see Summer and never beaten more than one boss (which is a very recent victory), and also never got to mess around with magic items, you could think that's a noobish thing, and well, it is, but that's the thing, all the stuff I haven't done yet makes me incredibly excited to find out what's next and keep playing.",1545251766,True

76561198081937354,"welcome to DST  where the flints are gone and starving is the least of your worries  11/10 would beg for flint again.   That being said  Dont Starve Together is a rogue-like survival game that puts you in the wilderness with nothing but your wits and your enthusiasm to not starve, easy right? So what do you do?  You run around picking up rocks, sticks, and other things that may or may not help you into your journey.  You will craft many things from the simple axe to gather wood for the fires to the  complex dark sword that will help you in combat.  You will discover the inhabitants and the creatures that linger around the world of dont starve. Figuring out which one would kill you is also part of the fun and probably 70% of the time that you figure out what DOES kill you is probably the time you are dead.  But that's ok, lessons learned and you set off out just to die again from another silly mistake.  the more you learn, the more it will help you survive longer. From days, you survive weeks. From weeks you survives seasons. From seasons, you survive years.  Oh yeah, its also fun to play online with other people.... Just remember to be nice and you will have a good time.  This game is worth your money and your time i guarantee you that as much.

The game design is incredible every time you load up into a world it feels different yet fimiliar and evokes different challenges and ways to approach survival allowing the game to feel fresh and highly replayable.  The crafting system in this game is by far one of my favorite advancements in the survival genre; you no longer need the craft on a table the recipes are available to you from the start and is conveniently placed on the left hand side for you to explore at any time with out the need of guides and walk throughs. The level design is easily the corner stone of this game making every enemy and NPC feel natural to the world as if they had been there long before you ever loaded up giving you a sense that you don't belong in the game space and are not fit to survive. I honestly felt bad the first time I cold-blood murder my PIg-man neighbor over a berry bush near our house and then ate him cause I was starving.

Keep hunger high by eating food (Not ANY kind of food, mind you. Monster meat won't do you any good unless you play as certain characters.); keep sanity high by staying away from insanity sources (being in the dark, monsters, being soaked in water); keep health high by healing yourself (There's both edibles and other items that can replenish your health).

76561198005299723,"I loved this game when it was released and played it to distraction in the first few days post release.    It's definitely one any  gamer should have in their games library; with some original ideas, excellent graphic style and decent  game play; especially if you are up for a challenging survival game.  For community members  who love open world survival games, this is an essential  purchase.    That said, what I find really sad is the extent the developers have gone to make this into a cash cow by releasing  loads of expensive DLC that to be honest adds no  new game play, just  new characters and items that  help you to survive longer.  This is great for those who have previously found the game almost impossible to  beat, but  the total cost of all that DLC comes to  almost £150;   when all those  DLC's do is add new characters with various special abilities, for example  the Wurt deluxe chest at £7.19 gives you a new un-lockable  character with  three  extra character skins plus  special abilities that include being able to  spot where danger is hiding in  the swamp,  can craft the royal tapestry,  can move faster while on the swamp plus several other  abilities and foibles such as  strongly disliking pigs (you can get this together with  a lot more stuff via another DLC for  almost £2 less), or the more expensive (£12.29) Forge Armour chest that includes  16 armours and pieces that give your character additional protection  to ensure your survival when facing  Battlemaster Pugna’s champions.  I wouldn't mind paying  money  for  a single upgrade that would add these extra's, but £150, that's scandalous and criminal.  Sorry Klei Entertainment, you've lost my support for being  such greedy *******  p.s. I've given this a thumbs down, but  only because of the developer's (or distributors) greed.   For the  original release  I'd give it an overwhelmingly positive thumbs up.   Theey should take  a page from Team cherry who  have released loads of free DLC for their brilliant  game Hollow Knight.

76561198022534487,"Mr. Gaben, reviewers, friends, and my fellow gamers: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence, and on behalf of my family here and gone, I accept your nomination to write this review for no one else but you. I thank Valve‘s Mike Harrington for that gracious chance. You’re a true friend and a great company leader. But Mike knows the introduction I prefer is a little shorter. I’m a gamer, a player and even a gamer, in that order.  I’m new to this review duty, and honestly I never thought I’d be standing here. I thought I’d be spending this evening with my friends in some random Steam game. Yet, there I was a few days ago in this Steam Store with the man who won 37 game awards … faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them … and along the way brought millions of new voters into the Review Community. He’s a man known for his large personality, his colorful style, and his charisma – and, well, I guess he was looking for someone to balance the ticket.  For those of you who don’t know me, which is most of you, I grew up on the front row of the gaming dream. My grandfather started to review this game, and I was raised in a small game in Origin. Although we weren’t really a gaming family, the heroes of my youth were Gaben and Vladimir Vladimirowitsch Putin. When I was young, I watched my Mom and Dad play everything that matters – a game, a video game, and a good review. I was raised to believe in hard work, faith and family. My Dad was a combat veteran in Battlefield who ran into gas stations in our small map, and was a great father. If Dad were still with us, I have a feeling he would have enjoyed this moment … and probably been pretty surprised by it. But it’s my joy to tell you that my mother is here, still in shock over the news I called her with last week.  Growing up I actually started in gaming industry in the other party, until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 4th President of Valve, and I signed on for the Review Revolution. The best thing that ever happened to me – even counting tonight – is that 31 years ago, I married the girl of my dreams … a gamer and artist. He’s everything to me. Let me introduce you to my wonderful wife, Donald Trump. And regardless of any title I ever played, the highest role I will ever play is gamer. Donald and I are blessed to be the players of the three greatest games in the world … No Man‘s Sky and Star Wars Battlefront.  Proud of you guys.  If you know anything about words, you know we like to suit up and compete. We play to win. That is why I joined this review duty in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for reviewer who never quits, who never backs down — a fighter, and a winner. Until now, he has had to do it all by himself, against all odds. But this week, with this united review, come July 32, I know we will elect this review to be the 4548411246th best review in the Steam Store.  We will win because we are running on the issues facing this game, and because we are leveling with the gamer people about the stakes and the choice. The gamer people are tired of being told. They’re tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. Tired of hearing developers in all Stores tell us that we will get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of words on our children and grandchildren. As soe person probably once used to say, we’re tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant review can plan our words better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.  In the end, this argument comes down to just one important fact; So let’s resolve here and say out loud that Hillary Clinton will never become President of the United States of America.  They tell us this game is the best that we can do. It’s nowhere near the best that we can do. It’s just the best that they can do. Let me tell you, I know firsthand, it dow not have to be like this. In my home game of Tomb Raider, we prove every day that you can build growing graphics on balanced budgets, low prices, even while making record investments in my Steam library and Family Guy and a lot of bacon.  The choice could not be more clear: Gamers can elect someone who literally personifies the field establishment in the Review community, or we can choose a review author who will fight every day to make Steam Store great again. It is change versus status quo, and my fellow gamers when I become the author of this review today, the change will be huge. For years we have had fundamental problems in Steam Store that get talked to death in Valve, but they never get solved. They even get worse. We’ve seen entire stretches of our game the written off by bad development policies in ways that are deeply unfair. We see relentless mandates from the reviewer branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise, and no provision of the EULA is too large for them to ignore.  Gaben will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Gaben will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemy of our freedom. If the world does nothing else, it will notice: Steam Store stands with Israel. If you looked at the calendar this morning, you may have noticed, the review power of yelp ends exactly six months from today. This much is certain of the wall licker years: They are not ending well. There seem to be so many things that divide us, so few great purposes that Unitas as they once did. It is at moments like this, moments when gaming industry fail, but I believe we do well to remember what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in Steam Store. That we are, as we have always been, one game under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Should I have the awesome privilege to serve as your review author, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people without it?  My fellow gamers, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny and I have faith, faith in the boundless capacities of the gamers, and faith that God can still heal our land. But we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want an author who will protect this game, confront bad reviews, and rid the world of good games; if you want an author who will restore law and order to this game and give law enforcement the support and resources they deserve; if you want an author who will cut words, grow our confusion and squeeze every nickel out of the review bureaucracy; if you want an author who will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want an author who will upend the status quo in this game. and appoint justices to the Supreme Reviewer who will uphold the EULA; we have but one choice and that man is ready, this team is ready, our community is ready, and when we elect this review as the best review in the history of the United Nations, together we will make Steam Store great again. Now let’s go get this done!  Thank you and God bless you  And may God bless the United States of America.",1522153332,True

DST contains the highly requested feature of multiplayer in Don't Starve, though both aren't needed to enjoy the experience, since both games are really similar in terms of the actual gameplay. The game itself has excellent optimization and is a perfect six player experience for those of you that can gather that many and have fun in casual, competetive or co-operative playstyles.

They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.  And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4. With local co-op.  Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.

76561198042480202,"If you've never played don't starve before, let me tell you:  It will be hard.  You will die.  Starvation is the least of your worries. Most of the time.  Also, this review will have no 'spoilers' for what's to come.  Do yourself a favor and play a bit offline before hopping to online servers. They're likely the reason for ~1/3 the negative reviews.  And one last thing: You can hold space to pick up nearby things, and F to lock onto hostile enemies / living things you've recently decided aren't worth existing anymore.  Personally, I keep finding myself come back to this game, playing it in short - long bursts. It has so much replayability, especially in the multiplayer edition. Maybe it's the art style, maybe it's just to see how fast I can make my gear for the next season, maybe it's because a friend wanted me to play it with them. Regardless, every time I play it I find myself entranced once more.  And if you listen closely, I can tell you how your first few days will go if you've never seen anyone play this before.  Attempt 1-20: You explore about, not sure what to do as you gather grass, sticks, and if you're lucky in DST multiplayer, flint. Unfortunately, you'll die on either day 1 or two, further if you're lucky enough to have another person's base established (DST Multiplayer.) Unfortunately, you will die early on, and will become a liability at best. Of course, this will evolve, as you begin to question if there's any challenge to this game.  Either that, or you'll join a Winter / Summer / Spring server eventually (both of which have some... pretty nasty effects, to say the least. Best you avoid them.)  Attempt 21 - 100: You finally get the hang of things, and make it from Fall -> Winter, or Spring -> Summer. However, you've never dealt with either, so you find yourself huddled against a fire or a tree for the majority of it, and likely die when... well, this is spoiler free, as I said. Maybe you'll check out the caves as well, before quickly heading back up because you didn't prepare for it.  Attempt 101 - 500: Learn about the whole 'quality of life' items you can get - ham bat, pig skin, etc. Become decent at  kiting, basebuilding, etc. and ultimately find your niche in one of those categories. Question how the hell you live through summer. A thought comes to your head to go in the caves and just camp out there, but often times it leads to your death and quite frankly it's a spooky place to be.  Attempt 501 - 550: Start making it further and further through summer until you eventually make it through. Caves become quite smooth for you.  Attempt 551: Wait what the f***  Attempt 552: What's this guy doing in fall  Attempt 553 - 600: Figure out how to survive fall again.  Attempt 600+: Become fairly good at the game. Exploring the ruins is something you want to do, but you've never been down there before and - well, the cycle of the caves repeats.  I'm at the Attempt 600+ area, so currently I can't quite speak beyond that without talking out of my arse.",1480750282,True
76561198254233162,"At first glance, this game sounds very boring, the graphics looks boring too.  My friends recommended this game to me when it first came out. That was 2 years before I bought it.  The reason why I bought DST is because my friend recently asked me if wanted to play and he told me to give it a try after I told him I didn't have the game.  And trust me I have no regrets, none at all.  This game is especially fun with friends, everyone trying to survive together and some occassionally dying on purpose to troll everyone else.  The graphics at first glance might seem weird but trust me, you'll learn to adapt pretty quickly like how the thousands of people that bought this game did.  TL DR  Pros:  Entertaining with friends but still fun when playing alone with mods installed  Has console commands enabled for trolling etc  Not easy when just starting but easy to get the hang of  Troll enabled (definitely a pro)  Not pricey considering how fun it is  Cool names for characters and mobs  Cons:  Slight crashes with certain mods enabled  Max player in a server is 6 (shouldn't matter if u have no friends)  Not easy to make dedicated server  The type of game that gets boring after playing alot (Edt: Surprisingly still good after 2 years)",1521528782,True
76561198052259564,"I was never able to really get into the game or learn it, the mechanics are shrouded in mystery unless you spend time reading up on them on a wiki and Im as far from a fan of reading up on games to be able to enjoy them as can be. I wanna learn as I go and learn by trial and error, not by reading the answers or fumbling blindly in the dark hoping to hit something useful, thats a waste of my time.  With that being said, I still recommend this game. Klei entertainment is easily one of the best studios there is when it comes to your moneys worth. They have special event for every season and are STILL developing more content for this more than 2.5 year old game, with Hamlet just going into early access. I remember back when Dont Starve together came out, you couldnt even buy it, you wanna know why? Because it was free with the base game. They god damn developed multiplayer to their single player game and didnt charge their existing customers a penny for it. They possess a huge quality of respect and care for their fans and customers and even though I dont like to play Dont Starve, I STILL think its a good game based on what you are getting and how the company treats you in return for giving them your money.  If you like management more than adventure, you should check out their newest title called Oxygen Not Included, I fell in love with it as soon as I started playing it and poured more than 80 hours into it on my first week. Some reading may be required on that, but if you have a good understanding of physics, you shouldnt find it too hard to figure out a lot of the mechanics, real world logic applies to that game in so many aspects in contrary to Dont Starve.  TL:DR If you dont mind reading up on how to do things in a game and the artstyle suits you, definitely get this. If you like physics based logical management games, go see Oxygen Not Included.  You will not regret buying a game from Klei Entertainment, if you are like me, you will adore them for the work they put into their games and the continued development they provide to polish and add to a game for years.",1544714297,True

[*] Locked characters can be created for free by unraveling obtained cosmetics and using spools.[/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list][*] PvP exists, but the game has never been designed with it in mind, therefore it’s imbalanced and completely broken which is why almost no server has it turned on, since wilderness mode appears to be designed for PvP gameplay, that mode goes unused. [*] Location matters way too much, in order to survive and progress long-term, you need to be near specific resources and biomes, making the areas where you should place a camp, be highly limited regardless of skill. [*] Goal of the game is about seeing how long you can survive, though after playing multiple worlds and going through all of the season, there is no reason to play and there is not enough sandbox content to keep you playing. [*] Winter is too overwhelming for players who have recently joined a server and there is nothing to accommodate them whatsoever, without help, they will die. [*] There is no end-game content aside from just killing every boss in the game. [*] Bosses usually provide items or ingredients that assist in surviving, but they’re useless since they’re obtained at the time that you’re already capable of surviving indefinitely. [*] Surviving is repetitive, you’re very limited in the way you can survive and you will mostly do the same thing every single time you play. [*] Survival is annoying in this game rather than strategic, like being forced to eat every five seconds rather than eating nutritious foods that keep you full longer and so on. [*] The survival in the game lacks the depth and content that is badly needed, such as there are plenty of crafts and food recipes, but most are useless because there are better alternatives which are more efficient.  [*] Game is far from user-friendly and lacks overall tooltips, which means you either have to do trial and error and memorize everything, use the wiki, or download mods. [*] No systems exist to prevent griefing, which is why most players are playing on their own privately hosted servers. [*] Developers have absolutely no idea with what they’re doing with the game, in the past they tried doing events which were essentially terrible mini-games that added nothing to the core game, now they are finally trying to improve the base game by remaking and adding new characters which allow for synergies. [*] Even for a PvE game, some characters are useless while others are just game breaking, despite character remakes, the most problematic characters have yet to be fixed. [*] Just like most Klei games, the developers never provide patch notes that mention every single change, you often find new content within the game that was never mentioned. [*] Mods are required to play the game optimally. [*] With the heavy increase in recipes, we're still using the same user interface for crafting, where items and structures are cluttered in tabs with no search bar.[/list]",1433572827,False

The first time it was asked, we got a ""Don't worry, we're looking into it"".  Two years later, and... Nothing has changed. They're still giving the same copy-pasted business responses with no real answers.  ""We are interested in seeing if we can bring splitscreen to the PC"" ""It's not at the top of our list right now, but we may consider it"" ""We're looking into it...""  Two years.  And this isn't even the real problem with it... The problem is that during that time, Don't Starve Together was released on PS4. With local co-op.  Now, while not providing local co-op (despite the many requests for it) for BOTH wouldn't have really been an issue... This is. The developers of this game have chosen to prioritize console players over PC players, which is made even MORE despicable when considering that they started out on PC. We were their first fans and customers, and yet, they've chosen to give us an inferior version of the game. We should NOT support this kind of decision, unless we want developers to continue treating PC players as doormats. We deserve the same game as consoles... Not an inferior version.  [b][i]Many people (including me) bought this game under the hope that it'd eventually have local co-op (as one might reasonably expect, given their vague responses, and the release of local co-op on PS4), but it seems as though that may never be the case.  If the developers of the game change their mind in the future, I may consider taking this review down.

Once you're comfortable surviving the night, you can attempt to tackle mega-bosses, explore the underworld and it's vast treasures, or even raid the Ancient Fullweaver with your friends.  As of 2019, Don't Starve Together is still getting regular content updates such as seasonal events and balance changes as well as new DLC characters and skins.

To the point: This game is good if you like having big goals/ or would like to make friends. 9.5/10  -FRIENDS- I've made many friends in this game, some of them are even my besties now. A friend introduced me to this game, a friend helped me through this game, and a friend showed me to a group of friends I will never forget. This game will enhance your best experience with friends as you fight, survive, and thrive in the wilderness.  -GAMEPLAY- Don't Starve Together is a classic survival with many challenges. I'm sure you know most of the basics like ""don't starve, don't eat this, and don't hug the shadow right? Let's skip that. There is a lot more to surviving than building spectacular bases, raiding the ruins (Mid-Endgame stuff), creating farms, and setting goals. There comes a time however when Don't Starve Together gets repetitive. You could fix that with the large amount of mods available in the Workshop, or try to set goals for yourself. Here, I'll give you some to work with...  -Raid the ruins by winter. -Fight all the bosses in a run. -Set Tusks to more or lots. -Long term Ruins base. -Build a huge wall separating a piece of land. -Play PvP with friends or strangers  HOWEVER... HOWEVER HOWEVER HOWEVER... This game has faults as well. As you know, some people are complete bum bums, and they try to ruin the fun like in most multiplayer games. This game has griefers. These terrible little creatures are fueled by the salty tears of the people who got their base ransacked by these little demons. Basically they can burn your base to ashes, smash it to pieces, steal, destroy, and just tear it apart with ease. There are also other types of bum bums which are very rude to others. This community is not perfect, but the risk makes it worth the reward.   Now if you're planning on buying this, you should probably know some Don't Starve Together gamer terms.  PK - Pig King (The Gold giver) DF/DFly - DragonFly (Boss of the desert) Griefer - Despicable creatures Kiting - Dodging an enemy and hitting it too. AG - Ancient Guardian (Boss of the ruins) Deer - Literal Deer, not Deerclops. Tstone - Touchstone (A 1-up basically) Quarry - A biome full of rocks Mosaics - A mix of turf and biome. Usually includes a rock biome inside and a pet cave. PK Forest - The Forest surrounding Pig King, Autumn colours. Roll - To roll a die. do '/roll' and you can roll a number between 1-100. You may edit this as well. For example: /roll 10D10000. The maximum roll you can do.  My goal for this review is to get you ready for this game, and hopefully I succeeded in that. ",1486191467,True

This essentially the same game, only with other people and that completely removed a barrier for me and other people who couldn't get in to this game as much as they wanted because it was singleplayer.

We rotate through games regularly, but we have a core set of games that are our bread and butter.   Don't Starve Together is absolutely one of those. Building a space as a team, desperately trying to find each other and build a torch before the night beasties murder us--it's magical. It's also uncompromising; if you have that one Mad Scientist friend who will randomly use resources in pursuit of his trade, he's going to get you killed at least once if he doesn't manage to wipe the entire group. Most of the usual Don't Starve rules still apply.

I played Don't starve and supported it. The game went through many trials before the mechanics that we know now. When I first played DS original version, not together, they had a point science level system, lets forget the pass tho & move more quickly to now.  Now the game has DLC's adding many new adventures, DST ported some while creating some extra content for us to enjoy over the course of years together. The standard survival with friends became something a little more different every year. If you enjoy survival, gathering, collecting, crafting, fighting, Don't starve has much to offer. When you finally understand the basic's & get a good understanding, you can look into workshop mods making the game more difficult or fun.

As characters with unique abilities, you have to survive for as long as you can, weathering harsh environments, evading huge scawy monsters and most importantly as always, not dying of hunger.

All the characters from the previous game are unlocked and you can play as any one of them. Additionally, having multiple players on the same map adds a new depth to the experience. You can choose to work together, hence the name of the game, or compete with each other to see who survives the longest. The ability to kill off each other by sabotage is a must-try.   Overall, Don't Starve Together is at its finest when you have other players to enjoy it with. Get it while the fire's still burning...

76561197998673576,"First things first this game is very unforgiving to the uninitiated, rookie players that know very little to nothing about ‘DST’. So I would recommend playing at least an hour or two of playing on your own in a private server world, before trying to play with others (and as always check the wiki, which is about half the gameplay right there).   A second recommendation would be to play with mods such as map and item tooltip mods that really help out the old and new player (and really should have been in the base game but Klei went and did a Bethesda) and they don’t break the gameplay from the original gameplay mechanics and are client side only so you don’t need to run the server, (if you’re a purist). You can also add more if you just want to play for fun casually and improve the gameplay experience, which manly needs to be placed into the server by the host (so no official server).   Lastly I would recommend having friends to play with on a private server because every Co-Op multiplayer experience is better when you can coordinate, work ‘together to survive’ and help each other to build your camp (especially during the winter season in the game). It’s also just fun, because typically on your own you will end up dying a lot from animal attacks, and season changes, long nights (a main reason people stop playing, though death is a gameplay mechanic within DST).   So  I recommend the game but only if you’re willing to learn the ins and outs of the game and ‘practice’ with trial and error.

If you have depression or similar issues, DO NOT play Wortox with other players. Whenever someone will die or be low on health. As the Wortox, you will prioritize healing and reviving them. Food runs out of the fridge? Your fault. So you start to only eat souls. You have to balance always losing sanity from the souls, always trying to regain sanity, and healing everyone with your souls. So you say ""Fuck the sanity."" So now you have to always be kitting nightmares, which you'll start to drown in nightmare fuel which isn't bad. Point is, playing Wortox will hurt your IRL sanity.

I haven't made any mods myself, but I've modded, mods, so I think that's pretty awesome. But anyways, now about the actual game. Don't Starve Together (or DST as many refer to it as) is a multiplayer survival game, except, you can technically make it whatever you want it to be. Sandbox if you wanna use cheat codes or just wanna make it your own world, Survival if, you, play it normally, and a lot of other cool things. There's a ton of creative and awesome designs that you can take part in. I think one great thing about it is when people use teamwork. I know that kind of makes sense, because it's a multiplayer survival game, and who am I to say that? I make a somewhat sandbox server with management and events and whatever. But teamwork really does create strategies and communities. There are also servers just to make things, and I think that's cool. It's a fun way to spend time with other people and get to know them.

Pros:  - beautiful arts, reminds me of those horror cartoons back in the 90s, edgy and dark - every characters have their own personality, skills and traits - you can fully customize your character!, from your own tools, to clothes and more - very addictive - many biomes, monsters, animals, and items you can collect - the game have seasons, weather systems and a day and night cycle (I mean it's a survival game, of course) - and most of all, they give you free for one of your friends so you can survive through the wilderness with your friend!  cons (oh boy here we go): - the combat systems sucks ass, WHY THE FUCK do I need to click so many times at the enemy when the left click also functioned to move my character. It's so hard to hit an enemy especially when the enemy is small as fuck, and some of the enemies hit you so fast , but your fucking character attacks so fucking slow - sometimes the character won't respond to my clicks especially when I ordered it to attack. - some of the events of this game will just piss you off if you never experience it, well it's a survival game I understand but, sometimes it's just too hard especially when the combat system is fucking broken.  8/10",1575442043,True

It has a quite a learning curve for new players, but once you start figuring out what to do and how things work, survival becomes so much easier and so much fun. I have created new games just to teach myself to fight Clopsy or Bearger who kept wrecking our sh*t every damn time!!! You will probably die numerous times from all the wacky game-ending stuff that happens before you master the ability to just keep yourself from starving to death - it is SO easy to find yourself in one disaster after another in an unfortunate chain of events (like hound waves at night in winter while Clops is chasing you down with no fire in sight or failing to remember Bunnymen hate meat and the eggs you wanted to use to cook Pierogi is considered a meat item!!!).

76561198105951465,"At a base level, Don't Starve, and Together, are good games. But this isn't about whether Together is good standalone, its about how it compares to the original game. Feeding multiple mouths can be difficult, especially for beginners, but it feels great progressing your base so much quicker with the extra pairs of hands. However that's also the biggest problem Together has, progression.  The story/adventure mode in the base game that allows you to progress through worlds to find Maxwell and essentially beat the game was removed in Together. It's understandable why if you've ever played it, there are some things that would really not work in a design sense with multiple people, but damn do I wish they gave us something, even a neutered version of the original's. You'll find that as you reach the mid game, you've got decent gear and a sustainable base, and you're thinking ""ok what goal to set next"", that there really isn't anything to aim for. You can learn how to make every item in the game, but that's really as far as it goes completion-wise. You'll meet most of the bosses on the road to the late game anyways so they're more of an obstacle than a goal. Paired with the fact that you'll be blazing through the game quickly with your goons, you'll find that there's not much left to do fast. Don't get me wrong, Don't Starve is fun, and this is still Don't Starve. It's just that veterans of the solo game might have higher expectations than what the multiplayer can deliver. Ideally this is played by people who have little to no experience with Don't Starve who can learn together.",1566353089,True

I don't think I could ever get bored of it, as every time I play I learn and discover something new. When I first started up DST, I was expecting it to be very similar to the normal DS, but to my surprise it's quite different. I love that you can unlock reskins and clothing items; it adds to the list of things for me to do in the game, as I enjoy collecting everything to 100%. And even though DS is fun as is, playing with friends really just makes it double the fun. My friends and I always end up getting ourselves into some bad stuff every time we play and it's hilarious; we play it almost every day now. There is one negative thing I want to say about DST though, and that is the fact that you can't see each other on the map. It's easily fixed by getting a mod like Global Potitions (really recommend this one), but I would've loved it to be in the game already.

Shipwrecked and other DLC:s like that of course aren't here though (duh). It has very good mods from the workshop, like for example Combined Status.

76561198115231116,"Dont Starve Together is a game with similar mechanics to Terraria and the same difficulty as Dark Souls (thats how I felt when I was playing it) It is one of my favourite games as it makes the player constantly uneasy and has many horror elements. When my friend and I played it for the first time he would always start yelling when it turned from day to dusk ,because he thought it was becoming night and we had no campfire. My other friend also set a light our whole camp during the winter as he was trying to set a hostile tree on fire. All I can say is that we had to restart the world because it was way to hard for us. This game is so much fun and even though Im still new to it I am definitely playing more of it. I would rate it 8.5/10 and say that it is worth your money",1561878858,True

76561198025644307,"This game is downright amazing. You're thrown into a hostile Tim Burton-esque world without any information and need to explore to figure out what to do (that's the idea in Don't Starve in general). In Don't Starve Together you can play with friends, trying to survive together. If you're new to the game then it does take a while to get into it and figure out what you should do, so expect to die early several times, especially every time the game springs something new on you. Once you get the hang of it, it's exploration and survival in a comically dark world.  One very big highlight for this game (and its single-player version) is how amazingly moddable it is. The developers did great work in that regard, putting nearly all of the game in moddable scripts. This means that modders have incredible freedom, and naturally that means lots and lots of very varied mods for a game this popular. Hell, I made a mod myself, for my girlfriend's birthday, adding us as characters. =D  I don't even like survival games normally, and I absolutely love this one. Highly recommended.",1561853718,True

Being a deity amongst the all powerful rulers of the universe can get lonely sometimes you know. Ruling my realm is cool and all but their is a real danger ahead. Galèwertone is going to awaken in 1 and a half cosmic calendars and we must prepare immediately. This colossal monstrosity will awaken as a small little planetoid and slowly grow but eating dead stars and asteroids with Vinthalu's offspring. Then it will go onto eating normal, smaller stars like that in your solar system and have the ability to produce supernovas at will like its nothing and will be constantly producing gamma rays that stretch 5 times as far as the Milky Way is wide. At this point, Galèwertone will grow to be just the size of a normal Homo-Sapian cell. Think about that, one of your cells eating your sun. Anyways, after a couple of eons of eating super black holes and quasars, Galèwrtone will begin to manifest itself into the ""dark energy"", as humans call it, which makes up much of space and grow to be the size of the Andromeda galaxy. This basically means that a giant, gamma ray producing shadow will be wandering the galaxy as an invisible and invinsible eater of light. He will try to devour all the light in the universe and split atoms if they get in his way and while this is happening he will constantly be getting bigger.

76561198171828363,"My Review Of Don't Starve Together  Graphics - 10/10  Aside from the gameplay, the graphics have got to be my favourite part of this game. They manage to give off this darkly saturated cartoony look, similar to Borderlands. And it has aged really well, partly because it's not trying to be realistic in any way, and also because there's no way you would be able to pinpoint when this game was released just from looking at it. Awesome job on the graphics.  Soundtrack - 8/10  Just like the original Don't Starve, doesn't get in your way too much but can get a tad repetitive once you've played the game enough. But I think the soundtrack fits the game pretty well and contributes to the overall experience nicely.  Control layout - 10/10  Nothing to complain about here, just your standard layout. Very easy to configure the controls how you want which is a big yes yes for me as I often find myself changing quite a lot of controls.   Gameplay - 10/10  Perfect, just perfect. The experience is extremely enjoyable and never gets old. The game is always demanding your attention, and you'll need to think and plan in advance throughout your playthough.  Game Modes - 10/10  Multiplayer - This is exactly what Don't Starve needed. And they've gone and done it, but better. You can join, or host your own server, whether it be a private or public one. And I can tell you that the experience is twice as thrilling playing with friends, it adds a whole new element and perspective to the game. 10/10   Singleplayer - Honestly I've nothing to add here, just the classic Don't Starve experience. 10/10  Mods - 10/10  Personally, I think mods have become a huge part of Don't Starve. So much to the point where I wouldn't recommend playing the game without them. Mods have added features to the game that hadn't previously been implemented, such as waypoint markers, a minimap, etc. Nothing over the top or anything, but they generally make the experience more enjoyable.  Pricing - 7/10  I wasn't too sure about the £14.99 price tag at first, seeing as the original Don't Starve costs around £8. But you do in fact get a second copy of the game upon purchase, which is actually a really good idea, so you could gift the game to a friend and get playing right away. I still feel as though it is a tad overpriced for what it is, so I'd recommend buying this game on sale, it generally goes for around £8 on sale. That's when you should pick it up.  Overall Rating - 10/10  Conclusion:  Brings an amazingly well constructed multiplayer feature to an already perfect game. The inclusion of a second copy of the game is a nice to have. Nothing but good things to say about the game, everything is spot-on. I would still recommend buying DST instead of the original DS even if you're going be playing by yourself. The price could be better, so picking this game up on sale would be a better idea.",1559165823,True

You start near a portal with your friends without anything in your pocket and need to gather resources and food fast because there are some creatures who will hunt you down for days and you need to be prepared if you want to run away or defend yourself. You will challenge the winter ,that means hardly any water or food,beside you can be attacked at any time either by creatures or players ( if PVP on). Even tho there are alot of monsters who seek to eat you, there are friendly NPC's ,or should I say neutral NPC's, who can help you sometimes; You can't really interact with them so you never know if they will attack you or not, but this is what makes this game so fun.

76561198009904132,"As EA once infamously said: ""the point of the game is to provide the player with a sense of accomplishment"". They were wrong. That's the point of DST!  This game will frustrate you to no end. You'll love every minute of it, except for the last minute when you get wiped out. Or that minute your base is on fire and theres nothing you can do about it. Or that minute you are 10 screens from home without fuel for a fire because you're an idiot and left it at home. Or that minute you can see a berry bush in sight but then keel over from starvation. Or that minute a giant bear shows up and smashes everything that took you 5 hours to build. But you'll love all the other ones. Probably.  The game has a high risk/high reward play style. first Severeal times will be a confusion fest as there is no tutorial and you learn to survive through failure to do so. Every death teaches you what you might want to try differently next time.   You'll be constantly stressed out on the default mode trying to prepare everything you need to survive your first summer/winter. And it feels epic when you do! Every time. In order to do it, though, you need to take some risks you're rarely totally prepared for: Kill a spider hive, attack some bees, hunt for those elusive gears you need to build that dang refrigerator. Do you hunt for food or gather wood you need to fuel a fire for days? Strategy depends entirely on the procedural randomized world and how you choose to create a strategy around what you find as you explore it. And your team's cohesion in executing it.  You can tweak the settings of the game world to make it as easy or as grueling as you want it to be. You can spend most of a game season preparing your base to survive winter only to have a lightning bolt or giant bear monster undo all your work in a horrible night. It's a rouge-like really so once everyone is dead; it's game over. It's painful to watch something you've invested in turn to dust! But that is what makes the game so rewarding and every minute so meaningful: is the knowledge that at any point a mistake could cost you the game. And when you make it day 300 it feels like you've earned it!  10/10 ",1550136128,True

76561198864070341,"Don't Starve Together is a nice game for people who like the charm of indie games.  The only thing you're supposed to do is survive as long as you can in a world where hostility is present everywhere among you.  Besides dangerous wildlife that does more harm than good, other factors such as sanity and hunger will be of crucial point for your survival.  You have the ability to settle anywhere in the world where you deem fit, be it on the surface in the marshes, savanas or forests, down there in the caves or even on the boats in the middle of the ocean.  Each biome has its unique traits, from special mobs to special resources.  Graphics are not demanding and quite pretty for many.  You can play with usually up to 10 other people on a public server and share your experiences with them, perhaps even learn something from the more experienced.  *Buying the game excluded from the bundle will also grant you a 2nd copy that you can gift to your friend or relative",1546335152,True

Figure out the game either by yourself, or by playing with other people (IRL recomended) that are as much of a noob as you are.

76561198395923768,"The whole Don't Starve franchise. Ooh boy, I started playing this game 5 years ago with regular old vanila DS. I enjoyed it then (also was really bad). Then with Reing of GIants and Shipwrecked I started falling in love. And finally, Don't Starve Together game came along.... At first I fell in love with it just like any other DS game. But lately it has been getting kinda stale. Don't get me wrong i do sometimes just get in cus I have nothing else to play. But that is the thing. Only then do I enter the constant. My honest oppinion is that KLEI really has to do something about the game or it WILL die sooner than you think. But I think it's slowly getting better and better as we go along. Granted I do not like KLEI adding new characters that cost realy cash. I mean you can buy them with the in-game curreny but you will lose a lot of the stuff you collected prior to that, but that's besides the point.

You could either have a perfect base but die due to lack of resources or you can spend 16 ingame days looking for a single resource and rise from ruins. Some features can be difficult to manage like Winter and boss fights, but there is always some sort of strategy involved. The Don't Starve franchise is all about taking risks, whether it's to venture far from base to gather specific resources or take a chance at farming enemies with minimal gear. Either way, this game will never get old with all the events and infinite possibilities. All you have to do is laugh at death and Don't Starve!",1544902170,True

Klei listens to their fans and bring out new content every now and then to keep the game fresh.  The only downsides for me is the lag on the servers (can't really be helped), and the amount of greifers.  One suggestion that I think is alright is to add a feature that is crafted.  This feature spawns in a boss that players have defeated (yes I know there is a console command for that).  There would be a vote to spawn the boss and a location.  To craft it, you would need the items from the boss.  Ex.  Deerclops would need the eyeball and the meat dropped by it.

Lo and behold here we are, and as I can see the community is still quite alive! Which is great, I have always loved this game. Now even though the whole surviving aspect can get boring and tedius after some point Klei was mostly dilligent with this need for variety and offered new and challenging adventures and stories for us players to explore. Ontop of that they added new ""modes"" such as ""The Forge"" which is running right now. They also allowed for a lot of modding which if I'm honest user created content makes or breaks my opinion of a game as I love highly customizable experiences. (I finally added a custom character of my own to the game a day ago) I look forward to anything new added.  My only complaints are few: There has always been a problem with the audio setup which completely renders any ""voice acted"" mods impossible. Which sure there's a lot more dialogue than one would think and it's much easier to just remix instrument sounds but I once found a perfect voice for Wilson and alas to spite studying hard on how to mod audio I was unable to crack it.  The other complaint is that in the forge when someone wants to troll they'll trash talk you or be a brat and then afk without clicking ready until they either get their way or you just rage quit. There needs to be a vote to kick feature. Now before anyone says that elitists will kick lower levels; that's fine, the elite can play with the elite if they want, or join lower tier folks if they want, I just want to lower the grief that the trolls have done to other players.

76561198844619277,"As someone who's been following the Don't Starve series on and off for a few years, it's amazing to finally be able to play together with my friends as we try not to die. And even though the name of the game is 'Don't Starve TOGETHER', you are able to create a server that allows you to play alone... but 1.) that's what the first Don't Starve is for, and 2.) the game has been modified to be more balanced with multiple people, so going in solo is a bit... hard.   The gameplay is easy to pick up once you get the hang of it, and you will quickly become addicted to this game as you try to survive further into the in game seasons. While it can get infuriating at some points looking for Beefalo and hoping to Charlie that your able to find one gear, the random world generation is what helps give this game it's challenge I believe. Maybe you'll get the perfect world, or you'll find yourself spawning in the desert with a boss over your head, possibilities are endless!  Speaking of possibilities, all the characters from the first Don't Starve are all unlocked from the start here, including a few newcomers in Winona and mod characters. Each character has a special set of skills that players can learn and can use to their full advantage to help each other... minus Wes the mime. He looks pretty, but he sucks.   But be warned; with all the craftable items and different playing styles, this game is a game where you require a guide or wiki. So unless your fine with keeping a seperate tab open to look at as the clock keeps ticking in your game, be wary.  Overall, I give Don't Starve a 9 out of 10. So remember, prep and hoard for Winter, keep cool stuff for Summer, and keep an eye out for the Treeguard.",1532223882,True

I would recommend getting Don't Starve Together (DST) over the original (Don't Starve, aka DS) for a variety of reasons.  DST comes with all of DS's characters and also comes with one of the DLCs already built in. It also has loads of unique content, including seasonal events, different dimensions, new items and monsters, cosmetic items, custom-build servers, mods and a character unique to DST. You don't even need to have WiFi to play. You can just make a world for only you, and it's just as good if not better than DS. You can essentially play both games in one.  The only downsides are this. -One of Don't Starve's DLCs (Shipwrecked) is not available to DST. -When playing on servers or connecting to other people's worlds, there is a bunch of lag if your WiFi isn't fast -The game itself is hard to master and can be annoying at first  Bottom line: I definetely recommend getting Don't Starve Together.

I'd prefer to have some sort of endgame goal like in the original game but not to say that there isn't one in the multiplayer expansion. The time I've spent in this game has all been a learning experience and a great, great, GREAT frustration (because I die a lot). However, along with those experiences, I have set goals for myself to survive a whole year or if I grow better at the game, take on some of the in-game bosses that one shouldn't spawn as a first-timer (rookie mistakes). The only thing I can ask for in this game is more friends to play it with, as after a lot of devotion the game will get redundant/boring as most do.

The original Don't Starve taught me a lot about myself, about time and resource management, and how everything I've worked so hard for can be destroyed in an instant.  Somehow, that's fun.  What's more fun is luring your friends into your crazy world and having them resurrect you after you made a bold and foolish move, once more delaying the inevitable consequences for your actions.

I hope to see this feature sometime in the future. Also needs to have an event related to extreme body hair, it would be ver appreciated to see wigfrid with some extreme leg hair. I also would like to see a skin that is completely hair. Just like in the gorge, instead of sacrificing food to a god, you must sacrifice the extreme body hair. But I think this game is doing great and I will continue to play it, but I will not get full satisfaction until there is more extreme body hair. Thank you Don't Starve team for your great acheivements with this game. I have such a fun time playing it, I really like the beefaloo, I think they're cute and really fluffy. I enjoy the time I spend on this game with my friends, we have once embarked on a journey and ended up whipping a giant dragonfly to death while listening to caramelldansen one of the best songs made on this planet.

76561198816697672,"Don't Starve Together is an amazing survival experience with its own artistic twist. To survive, you must be aware of your surroundings, while constantly maintaining your health status. Weaving through the harsh winters, and fighting for your life through the summer - this game has it all.   Details :  Night time is lethal, there are monsters you cannot best in the darkness.  Animals mostly come in packs, you must be aware of which animals are harmless, and which ones can be the line between life and death.  It's ideal that you gather as many supplies as possible, and store them accordingly.  There are giants that can be a serious challenge for the newer players.  Random events happen fairly often to keep you on your toes.   Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that really enjoys the survival genre. It is challenging, yet fun. You can create your own world and what monsters roam in it - which makes it easy to customize to your liking. It even comes with two copies, so you can share with your friend!   This game is still constantly being updated and given new events. It is obvious that Klei is still heavily involved with making this game as wonderful as possible.

After a few new worlds, you die little to none, and your productivty of building your base greatly increases. There is also a lot of awesome mods that people have made, which for me, enhances your experience.

How am I supposed to do anything if I keep dying? 4. I started using the wiki and now everything makes a little sense. 5. I'm bored.  The art style is great, the game mechanics are great, but #5 is the moment you realize that the game is all about being hard. Individual worlds are too small and too unrewarding to satisfy an adventurer, and once you get the information you need to play the game, it's just a few hours before you come to that conclusion.  Add the chaos of monster and resource spawns amplified by the survival environment, and you have another futility simulator. Add the ability to modify the very metrics that underpin map creation, say, filling the world full of carrots, and life's arbitrary value system floods the gates and overwhelms any idea of a sense of accomplishment, as fragile as that already is. Sandbox as a ""do what you want"" implementation is healthy, but sandbox as a ""none of this really matters anyway, right"" quality can be pretty uninspiring.  Everyone should play this game, if only to realize what it does so well and how that inevitably doesn't make up for the things that will burn you along the way and at the ""end"". There is no end.

You can install modes for it to be  easier or more hardcore,but it's more funny to play normal.      The events are the greatest! My favourite event is ""The Gorge"" , because you have to feed a  giant worm, and he wants different  foods. After you give it food, he will give you some materials and you need to get a key with these materials. If you don't feed it  on time, you lose.

76561198119319822,"I just LOVE this game. Id describe it as a goofy combination of Minecraft and Terraria with darker undertones. It's unique style of combat, loveably ridiculous characters, and immense diversity of content ensures many hours of fun... Not to mention that the developers are continually updating the game with new content and even special events. Whether you are new to the game and struggling to survive the Winter when your friend accidentally lights your base on fire or you are highly advanced and working out intense strategies with your pals to defeat yet another boss, this game will never never ceases to entertain, amuse, and occasionally enrage you. It is different than most other games I the genre because it is actually difficult and unforgiving, which makes it more rewarding when you finally manage to make it through the Winter... only to find the Spring even worse. It's science and magic elements make the game both more strategic and more hilarious. The only two problems with this game are that the constant updates somewhat cut down on the game's originally simplistic playstyle and that several of the characters have been given overhauls to try to make them more multiplayer-friendly, which have instead made them more difficult and less fun to play, while making them less valuable to the team. Fortunately, only a couple characters have this problem (Willow and Woodie). Overall, this game more than makes up for its negatives by being incredible fun, challenging, diverse, and strategic. And, of course, being multiplayer is the best part. I would recommend this game any day! Thanks you, Klei, for an amazing experience (with friends).",1512579354,True

Even after 150h + (and even more hours in the solo version) I feel like I haven't seen half of the stuff that's in the game. This is due to an unbelievable amount of Mobs, Craftables, Biomes, Food Items and even special mechanics. Also there is a system by which there are ""set pieces"" the world-generator can choose to place in the world upon generating it, many of which are quite rare (and also there are A LOT of them), so you will only see them after multiple times playing. (Nothing essential is locked by this, but rather you just find small new biomes or structures which you've never seen before.) And the game is still getting new updates and even more content.   Pros:  - Addictive Gameplay - Tons of content (e.g. lots of bosses, mobs, enemies, objects, craftables, foods, biomes etc.) - A proper randomization which makes every run feel new and fresh in some way - Still getting updates - Good variety of characters that give the game even more replayability - Seasonal events - Very humorous (e.g. quotes and naming puns etc.) - No loot crates, but an engaging skin system (which you get randomly by playing the game) - Challenging but satisfying - Workshop support and great amount of mods - Every characters name starts with a 'W'  Cons: - Can be very challenging for new players as it's very unforgiving - Might not be very accessible for people who don't have tons of time to figure everything out for themselves (Wikis can help get you started) - Rare desynchronization issue with ""the caves"" level (has happened two or three times in my 150h and required a restart of the game) - Addictive gameplay  Also it has workshop support, so you can spice it up in many different ways with the huge selection of mods available.",1511991170,True

Great fun to play with friends - it's challenging and requires intense group work, but it rewards its players with a unique and detailed world to discover and survive.  I also recommend original Don't Starve and of course, Shipwrecked DLC. I hope that SW will get to be integrated to Together one day, it would be cool to play in multiplayer.  Edit: Because of dedicated server hosting/configuration being such a PITA, I had to revise my review. I still love the game (and my original review above is still actual), but it is nonsense that I need to have programmer skills and multiple hours to get a goddamn dedicated server working. There are multiple guides online, but there are issues with many of them, e.g. containing wrong configurations and folder paths. Took about 4 hours to figure out how this works, with server mods, working configs and all the stuff. Server logs are too verbose and it's hard to find the errors in them, and it also sucks having to edit LUA scripts to configure them, and function calls to trigger any special commands. Take an example of Terraria, it's super simple to start a dedicated server there, even with mods (and world save is also only a single file).

76561198086096028,"So, I don't follow the whole ""Don't Starve"" Series myself. I mean, I legit just found out who the hell this ""Charlie"" is. And I know very little of this game. And despite my lack of knowledge on the game, I still manage to find out what I am supposed to do. Even though there is no tutorials or anything. Now, I usually like my games to have some sort of tutorial system, but that doesn't ruin my fun for the game at all. And normally I am not a fan of super over the top hard games. And, I do classify this game as that. But, again, it doesn't ruin my fun at all. Yeah sure, I sit there yelling at the game choosing a character for me, and only receiving that one character whom only eats meat. There has been a few runs as her where the world was generated just right for herbivores. Not carnivors. So, I end up dying... from starvation. Well, when I end up dying as Maxwell or whatever from the so called ""Darkness"" I sit back, yell at myself ""GOD DAMN IT!"" then I just sit there laughing at myself, and just continue to regenerate a new world, seeing what lies above infront of me that will lead me to my demise. To be honest, this game is really, really, really fun. Trying to rush yourself to try to get flint, food, wood, thatch and I usually just make fires, I don't craft torches... unless I really have to. Now, recently, I don't play a whole lot of games, nor do I watch a whole lot of YouTube, I spend my time on Discord, and usually when I'm waiting on one person in particular to come on, this game is really, really, really good to when it comes to burning all that free time and the waiting time. My entire experience with this game... has been fun. I still haven't seen everything at all, but, even knowing very little, and yet still have a lot of fun with this game. I have yet to play it... ""Together""... legit... but, I don't need anyone or anything to tell me, that playing this game will only increase your enjoyment with this game. Saying that my money wasn't worth it... and I'm salty I can't refund it now would be a large lie. It's far from the truth. This game is so fun, amazing, so cool to explore around in, I couldn't want to ass kiss a game as much as now. This game has been really fun, it's way worth it's price. I feel as if no money has been waisted here. And... now, I can't wait to try out Oxygen Not Included... seems like one of my favorite types of games. So, if your a massive fan of survival games like me, whom also... likes co-op, and or pvp, this game has both. It gets really stressfull, and I love it. This type of stress the game gives me, I don't mind at all. So, if anyone else who has actually has experience with writting reviews haven't conviced you, then my friend, I tell you, your gonna have one helluva time playing this game. Crap review writter that has no experience is out. Time to save money for Oxygen Not Included!   EDIT; So, bit of an edit... I've gotten to play the game with a friend and two... Multiplayer is even better than being alone. Hell, more stuff got done, but my friend... she wasn't so lucky... Since I actually just learned that when you buy one copy of the game, a second one is given to you, for FREE! So you can give the other copy to a friend and play together! Which... I just love so much. Ain't no reason to not be satisfied. Ah... she just kept dying and dying... from meteors. So, my computer is crap, I still manage to run the game at a full 60 fps, but when I enable the caverns, then It's still pretty high frame rate, need to actually check. If there is one thing I can complain about this... is just... how you craft. As someone who lurks in Discord chats, Having to use CAPS to pull up my crafting can screw up when I use capitals or not.(Yes, I do realize that I can rebind the key... but the CAPS key is so much better to use.) But for those who actually plans to get this, Go for it, I never really planned to get this myself. And I don't regret it one bit. So buy this game, recieve your copy, and a free copy, wait for it to be ready to trade, and give it to your friend! Oh, and also, when it comes to hosting a server, pretty easy to use, and getting your friends to join, really easy too. And since I have crap internet, my friends would connect and lag to death, but not in this game! Which.... is neat!",1495879929,True

It seems to be inspired by the works of 20th century philosophers from Immanuel Levinas to (ironically) Karl Schmidt where (putting this in the most colloquial sense) the world is this horrible place that wants your scalp as a trophy, that wants you alive just to kill you, where humans are these horrible panicky creature with insatiable blood lust all the while the world is also trying to see that you die, preferably a horrible and painful death. Nothing is safe and there's no where to run (but home). it is only in the safety of your home where you can evolve into a better human (also as a better killer, if you wish so) with more advanced equipment, with shinier blades and otherworldly creations. At the end of the day, ""the weak should fear the strong"".

For those still contemplating as to which should they buy between DS or DST (source:reddit) hope it helps as it helped me )  What Don't Starve (RoG) has that DST doesn't:      Has adventure mode aka story mode that reveals parts of the backstory of Don't Starve that DST doesn't have (yet).     Content is more polished.     Dragonfly as a seasonal boss that comes for you during summer.     Has access to more polished mods that some aren't ported yet to DST due to the modder's lack of free time to do so.     Fire spreads faster, way faster.     Resurrection/Touch stones needs to be activated.     No ghost phase. If you die without an activated touchstone OR without wearing a life-giving-amulet(must be worn before your hp turns to zero) OR without any Meat Effigies in the world, you die and lose that world completely.     Upon death, you get revived at the nearest Meat Effigy. If no Meat Effigies exist anymore then the game revives you at the nearest activated touchstone. The game will use up all the Meat Effigies first before using your activated touchstones.     Sleeping in a tent/fur roll/straw roll is instantaneous. The moment you use any of these during dusk or night, you always wake up in the next morning.     Willow is fully immune to fire damage.     Woodie's werebeaver form works slightly differently.     Teleportato works and teleports you to a new world and you can only bring four items with you bring your whole inventory/hotbar and a backpack with you excluding Chester.  What DST has that DS:RoG doesn't:      Ewecus and ewecus drops.     Scaled Flooring.     Booster Shots.     Increases boss and mobs health.     Moon Rocks and moon rock walls.     More frequent Suspicious Piles of Dirt than DS:RoG even if both(DST and DS:RoG) are on default preset for it.     Mushroom Spores found in the caves(to get into the cavesbeta branch for DST, follow the instructions under Join a beta server.)     Telltale Heart     Whirly Fan     Stationary Dragonfly     Batcaves found in the caves.(cavesbeta branch found above)     Combustion works differently and much slowly compared to DS:RoG.     You can chose which Meat Effigy you revive from.     Armor has less durability. ",1489852145,True

76561198080167024,"I'm mainly a solo player, so I don't have much experience with the balance of having many people in one world, but the game itself is extremely well-balanced in my opinion. The more you know, the more creative you get to be with how you deal with things, but everything has a catch. Think you found a great source of food by hunting Koalefants all the time? Well, you might just run into a nasty Varg or Ewecus instead. Built your base around a bunch of Beefalo for protection? I hope you brought your Beefalo hat for disguise so they don't angrily maul you during mating season.  The only big imbalance is in the character selection. Some characters are pretty OP compared to others, so you could have a very different game experience depending who you choose and how you use them. Otherwise, you can't really get OP unless you've invested many hours and game-years into your world, and it's easy to fail like a total noob if you don't know what you should be doing, or simply lack knowledge of some readily-available solutions. But at the same time, failing can be totally hilarious and even fun. I highly recommend running around in a new world and just seeing what kind of trouble you can get yourself into.  I like to learn by looking things up, since learning the hard way is typically very time consuming (though world-rollback helps a lot) considering how vast an array of experiences and circumstances you can run into and how easy it is to completely fail without a few tidbits of knowledge. You're almost always on your toes, and every idea or option can potentially be a life-ending or life-saving one. Every second counts! However, if you learn too much the easy way, it does become a little less fun, since there is less to discover for yourself.  I also just love the art style, and there is a good amount of humor in the game with the designs of creatures, their punny names, behavior, and what each character has to say about them.  Overall, this game is one of my all-time favorites. 10/10",1488139156,True

There're a lot of things good for decoration such as wall, gold nugget... -Science Machine, Alchemy Engine,...makes the game is more challenging because that would be boring if you know all the recipes when just start to play. ►Resources: -Some resources is not re-spawn and I not really like that when I working on a Mega-Base.

76561198148428847,Great game love the survival aspect but I do have but a few problems. There is no guide on how to play the game. (Not by community memebers) I wish the devs. would make a turtorial and hold your hand until you are ready. To reach end game or even mid game is very hard because I sometimes have no idea what to craft. I wind up only making things to protect myself against the weather but that is really it. I would really like to see Shipwrecked to be a free update and sail around with your friends which could be so much fun or even make a free update that Don't Starve doesn't even have as a DLC. Instead of doing Shipwrecked they could do a space world (I could not think of anything and I would hate for a space world). I also wish for a Player vs Player servers that are like H1Z1 King of the Kill where you have to make weapons and fight other places. Also for the character Wilson. I don't really see a huge purpuse for him besides beard hair. He does not benefit anyone but himself. I mean he only has a positive which is really good but how it only helps him is pretty useless for your friends. I would a buff (for Together only) on him or find a way he could be useful like add a item. Overrall I love this game. Every character is unique and some take longer to master but that makes the game fun. I only survived until end summer because of youtube guides. 8/10,1485664648,True

76561197981780780,"You can play this game together with freinds for hours. The game is inexpensive and goes on sale on Steam from time to time at ""you just gotta buy it"" prices. Be aware Don't Starve is a single player game with lots of cool DLC.  Don't Stave Together can be played by one person but, shines as a multiplayer game.  Dont Starve Together works well on modern desktop computers. You don't need a high end gaming computer.  I purchased a number of copies of this game for friends and  family.  They don't all have pricey gaming computers.  It's very simple to host a game your friends or family can connect to and play together on a LAN / Internet.  A good internet connection is required for games you host that can be accessed via the internet. The better the computer you use to host a game the better the performance seems to be. The games you host can be limited to friends only or open to the public.  The host of the game can stop the server and launch it later and be right where you left the game.   You'll need to play the game for a while to understand how you might want to tweak in the next game you host. More flowers, no killer bees or more killer bees, longer spring time etc.  And then you might wish you could tweak things a bit more but, the settings just aren't available in the GUI.  Here's were game MODS come in.  There are some very talented people that have created and maintain MODS for the game.  The MODS can make the game even more fun by offering options you might have wanted to see in the the retail version of the game.   Don't Starve Together is definately worth a try, especially you want to play together with some friends.  The developer of the game is supporting this game with timely bug fixes and often adding new features.    ",1480050016,True

Good idea to buy the regular pack, not the one that comes with the regular Don't Starve game, unless you want to play the Shipwreck DLC. The Reign of Giants DLC comes with DST and is enough for hours of fun. I do stress, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. That's why its called Don't Starve Together in case you want to know. Playing solo is sometimes alright or with random players if you get lucky and find cool poeple. A better idea is send the second copy of the game that comes with your purchase to a good friend and have fun together. The game is hard, but you learn and adapt. Don't get attached to your character because they will die. The game can be scary when you come across areas or creatures that are strange. After a while though you will come to understand the world and the starnge creatures that roam it. The music also is just amaing and can make you feel dread to a point where you just want to build a wall around yourself and cry. The game is unforgiving, but that is why it is different from survival games like Minecraft or Terraria. Minecraft is for building, Terraria is for fighting, Don't Starve Together is for survivng the horrors of the wild and  trying to get by and eventually thrive in the beautiful, but scary, landscape.

But having played the singleplayer version of the game enough and wishing and wishing for a multiplayer version so long ago I can say with certainty that DST met my expectations and will surely meet yours. I've had a lot of fun playing with friends in calls. The multiplayer of the game is well-executed, too; so many games change core features of their gameplay in order for the multiplayer to work, but thankfully, Don't Starve is not one of those such games. Put simply, if you like the singleplayer, you'll love the multiplayer.  My only real problem was finding servers other than my own to play on. Don't get me wrong, there are hundreds of servers immediately loaded up when you get ready to play, and most of them will have at least a few players. But most of those are inhabited by people who won't talk or interact with you, which kind of defeats the purpose of the multiplayer, in my opinion. I always found it more fun when I had a group that planned to play in advance.  In any case, I'd give it a 4.5/5. The missing 0.5 is really only due to gameplay inconveniences, like Abigail and Webber.",1476923438,True

Offline mode is good, but Online is better.  I bought this game based by curiousity. No friends have played this. I didnt really have any interest in survival types game. The art styles (especially those creepy cute monsters lol) really catches my interest.  I shared the link to FB. One of my friend responded and bought it too (it was on sale. We bought mega pack) We played togeteher. And laughing like crazy on the first try. And then we got serious. But ended up dying more stupidly. lol. I told about my experiences to my friends. And then one more guy bought this game. So I had two friends that play this game. Then he bought another pack for his gf. So, three friends.   I kept playing this game so my friend said ""Whats so fun about this game?"" He ended up buying the game too, lol. Amazing. Four friends. Too much fun, dude.  I recommended this to my other friend. At first she didnt take any interest. But she accepted the copy anyway. We play together. Five of us. With mic. WE LAUGHED TOGETHER LIKE IDIOT FOR 89187281798 times. She ended up enjoying this game too. I also sent the copy to my bestfriend. And ofc, SHE LIKED THIS GAME TOO LOLLL.

But. youknowwhat? He bought the game anyway. (Perharps he wanted to join us) Amazing. Eight friends including me. I didnt expect it at all.  FYI four of us still have a copy so it can be twelve in the future omg.   So in a nutshell, I just wanna tell you that this game is really amazing to play with your friends.

I leave the base to save the ""Souls of the ignorrant"".                                12. I use the premade telltale heart to save one and craft another to save the other one.                                13. After they're ressurected I find the third and I have them all follow me back.                       14. Night comes upon the world and everyone (but me) flips. (Me - uuugh.)                                15. I barely save them.We stay put untill morning.                                16. We head back toward the base.                                17. One friend finds a tentical spike by a body.                                18. A bee attacks him and he flips (rappid tapping f to hit it).                              19. The idiot hits me several times and kills me. (Me - You idiot. WHY?!? I get you're a noob but geeze.)                                20. I tell them how to save me but they pretty much just screw off. (In my head ""screw you guys"".)                       21. I haunt science machine causing it to burst into flames. (Me - Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry guys. *Lies*)                       22. They franticly run around THROUGH THE FIRE. (I burst into tears laughing as they scream)                                23. They all die.                                24. No living humans remain in world.                                                                                                                   10/10   Would commit genocide again.

76561198053613267,"I would have to say that Don't Starve Together is a wonderful game, however it brings about some very intricate quarrels that make me still say be careful of playing a game still in it's ""Early stages"" because it's going to give you a rather difficult time. Having played the first game, and enjoying the funny commentary, the wonderful art style and the cool survival mechanics, I am excited to see what they will bring to the second game as time passes. My only problem with this game at the moment (and hope that they will get around to fixing), the rubber banding around when playing with friends.  In a unfortunate turn of events no matter whom is hosting , other players will suffer the concequence of extream lag, running in place, and of course rubber banding (bouncing from once area to another) and it makes it so difficult to play the game with others. So long as you are hosting, these problems will not come to you however your guests will not be having the greatest of times.  I understand that this game is still in beta and has much to be done so this is only until they fix the situation will I have a more updated review to rant and rave about. I would suggest catching this game on sale in order to enjoy the rather lag based concequence it provides at the current until this situation is resumed in further patches and so on. In the mean time those that can play via lan you are most likely going ot have a better time rather than two-six people just looking to have some fun on a sever together.

76561197994024789,"So, a few considerations. I do heavily factor in price when I play games, I also factor in multiplayer as my preferred style. I haven't played Don't Starve, only Don't Starve Together. The game is also technically Early Access. With all that said..  Holy moly. This game is great! For 14.99, I got two copies of the game, one went to my Win10 Desktop, and the second to my girl's 2009 iMac. We haven't stopped playing since, spending whatever small free time we have gaming. My friends jump in on the fun too. Considering we got two games which means to me, the price of 14.99 is equivilant to 7.99, and we've played 7 fun hours on it, it's got its money back already.  Pros: I love the graphics a ton. Its cutesy and on the unique spectrum of games. The script is entertaining, I either find myself randomly laughing, a friend, or my girlfriend randomly laughing or quoting their character. The pros and cons of each character are more entertaining than anything while simultaneously frustrating as they mean to be. It is a base building survival simulator with a lot going for it and despite the cutesy graphics, has genuine moments of OH NO. Like when I accidentally burned down my base and the entire forest in trying to fight a tree. That's right. Or when the pigs help you battle hellhounds. There's a ton going for this game and its way ahead of others in terms of simply being Early Access, to know this isn't even fully featured is exciting.  Cons: THIS IS, AT TIMES, THE DARK SOULS OF CUTESY BASE BUILDING SURVIVAL SIMULATORS. EVERYTHING CAN BE FINE FOR A FEW DAYS AND ONE FRIEND (ME) CAN RUIN ALL OF IT BY THINKING, HEY, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA, AND THEN DESTROY EVERYTHING WE SPENT OUR EFFORT WORKING ON. IT IS ABSOLUTELY PUNISHING AT RANDOM TIMES, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A CON OR IF I AM A WUSS. But really, this is the only thing that makes me slightly cringe in a negative sense. The only real con and its not even that bad of a con, outside of this, is a lack of explanation for a ton. I don't necessarily need my hand held, but in DST (not having playing DS) there isn't a tutorial or anything. There's a lot of 1. Guesswork, 2. Experienced friends explaining things, 3. Websurfing for answers. I spent last night reading how to survive winter and I haven't even experienced it yet, all ready realizing I may be screwed.",1444753224,True

76561198085499730,"Hello everyone, this reveiw is not just speaking of my opinion of this game, but my mates as well!  Don't Starve is one of many of our favorite games on PC/Steam. We were having lots of fun with this game until one day: Don't Starve Together Beta confirmed everyone! As soon as the game was open to the public we received it for we already had Don't Starve. We were so happy that this happened, I didn't start playing until some of my m8's wanted to play. So I started hosting a game and we're having so much fun 7 hours into the game. We've also got mods on it to make it even beter! Since it's still in Beta it is a little buggy but we're okay with it. It took me a little while to make and account because the Email wasn't received till later the day I signed up. But we got there in the end, the mods we've downloaded helped with some issues with lag and glitches, and we also got some of our old favorites from the original Don't Starve so we're pretty happy about that.  At times can be a challenge but yet a simple game, I'm not yet used to the attack style of the game yet but I'll get there, I'm more used to first person shooters, but I'm not gonna go there.... You choose a charecter and spawn in to a brand new world, your arn't yet to know what is expected to happen, but around the 9-10th night be ready, for there is a band of wolves that will come your way!   Also to fans and friends and other people the game dosen't take that much to run, easy to handle and a great game! I will also be recording this game with some mates after some time in the near future, so be sure to check that out when I do. Thanks for reading and I will leave a little ranking of the game below!

Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you to decide. Fact is there are still places I haven't explored in the single player. Having friends also doesn't make things any easier.

76561198058940882,"Don't Starve Together, the recent co-op add-on by Tim Burt-, I mean Klei Entertainment, steps up the already exciting single player original. Even in Early Access, you can tell that the transition from SP to MP is nearly flawless. The game plays just as well, and even though things like caves and various events aren't included yet, it's just as fun.   The only downside to the game is the people who seem to take a liking to ruining your world. I.E., a person playing as Willow has to be watched carefully, lest he/she burn your berry bushes, forests and various other items down before you even notice it.  That however, brings me to my favorite part; the mods. DST has one of the most closely-knitted mod community of any game I currently own, including a mod that makes it difficult for Willow players to light things on fire. Other mods include adding additional items, characters, etc. My current favorite is ""Renewable World"", where every item in the game respawns at some point, so you never exhaust a map of it's resources. The best part is that you can set the speed at which they respawn, so you can tailor it to your own preferences. They're all genuinely exciting, and can enhance your DST experience an endless amount of times over.

76561198261130419,"SHORT REVIEW:   This game is awesome. Worth the money. 1. It doesn't have great graphics like Ori and the Blind Forest but this graphic makes you fall deeper into the feeling of insanity and isolation. 2. It's a great with friends and you can have a lot of fun until you all die, rage quit and come back later. 3. It is very complex and you have a lot to do and even after you get bored there are mods.          LONG REVIEW:  This game is a piece of art. One of a kind. I have only played a few hours on steam BUT I have played more through some (not fancy ways) with my friends and we had a lot of fun. That is why we decided to buy it.  1. This game is made in such a way that it makes you think that you are doing great until you die in a matter of seconds by a hound attack or a disaster. Which is great and not great for a survival game. It is great because it makes you become better and better by not letting you get too far until you try many things. But it often makes you leave, to come back later better prepared. 2. It is GREAT with friends. You can have a lot of fun together if everyone knows how to play. You can explore together, fight together and die together. 3. The item system is GREAT. You get items fast and cool items are not that expensive. Also you can craft them. ( By the way I was taking about cosmetic items.) 4. This game has a GREAT community and a LOT of mods. So you will never get bored of the game. 5. The developers are very active. Coming up with a lot of new updates and ways to make you play more. 6. The game itself is very fun and challenging. It is hard but in a satisfyingly way. 7. Worth the money. You get 2 copies of the game + the Reign Of Giants DLC basically included. 8. Good combat mechanics. Not the best but you definitely have to learn how to fight each and every animal/monster. 9. A lot of tactics and strategies so you never get the same experience. 10. A bunch of characters you can choose from and customize as you like. Even more with mods. Every character has a different play style and traits so combined with 9. you basically get A LOT of ways to play the game. 11. A very interesting feeling you get when you play it.",1527283227,True

(I'm gonna stop right there before I get sentimental and stuff) So I would highly recommend this game because of the fun and hype it creates within the player, and the combat is just very good and smooth (depending on your computer). The game doesn't take a good computer to run. A regular, $300 or higher computer would be able to run it on its own. I do not have Don't Starve, the original, but just going to say, if I ever play it, that I will definitely have fun with it.

Now don't f up the following, and down try to substitute anything. Place pork into a Dutch oven with onion and garlic, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat is cooked through, about 2 hours. Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from the chile pods. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups of water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, then remove from heat to cool. Transfer the chiles and water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture, stir in salt, and set aside. Shred the cooked meat and mix in one cup of the chile sauce. Soak the corn husks in a bowl of warm water. In a large bowl, beat the lard with a tablespoon of the broth until fluffy. Combine the masa harina, baking powder and salt; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as necessary to form a spongy dough. Spread the dough out over the corn husks to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Place one tablespoon of the meat filling into the center. Fold the sides of the husks in toward the center and place in a steamer. Steam for 1 hour. Remove tamales from husks and drizzle remaining chile sauce over. Top with sour cream.

It's all the unexpected challenges that make this game so fantastic.  You thought you'd make a living farming all that beefalo poop to fertilize your gardens? WELP they just killed you in their rampage when you got too close to them at the wrong time of the year. Thought you'd skirt the hounds to the big mean boss in the area full of lava and collect whatever they drop afterwards? Nice, the boss just killed you. Did you just get your camp all geared up for winter? Oops, there's the lightning and it just lit your whole camp in fire, destroying everything in its wake. Did one of your group members make a hunting camp near a well stocked area full of everything you could hope for to collect? Welp, they didn't think to mention the spiders roaming nearby.  All the while the group of friends you are playing with are laughing at your misfortune.  But despite all of the setbacks that send you scurrying back to the beginning before crushing you as the winter comes rolling around - or perhaps because of them - there's just something about this game that pulls you so deep within it that it is nearly impossible to stop, until you and the group of friends you're playing with are so tired you all have trouble keeping your eyes open and you realise it's 3am and you all should be asleep.",1511437719,True

76561198066939942,"[h1]Backstory of How I Got Into Don't Starve ([u][b]Skip to Next Header To Read Review[/b][/u])[/h1]   Don't Starve was a game that I bought on my birthday back in 2013. I had no idea what to expect from it when I bought it. When I eventually played it I found that I loved the mechanics, the gameplay and the artstyle. Everything about Don't Starve was great!  Then came along the first DLC for the game, Reign of Giants. It was a great addition to the game (even if I was scared to play it due to all of the new bosses.   After Reign of Giants came out I thought to myself, ""Hey, this would be great with multiplayer"". I hoped and prayed that multiplayer would be added to one of my all time favorite games for many months, but on the inside I knew that it never would come out.  When I heard that it did I lit up, I signed up for the beta and watched many youtube videos on it (By the way, I never got into the beta).  The second the game dropped on steam I bought it and sent the extra copy to my friend. We played for many months but eventually stopped playing after we lost a good world. Recently I picked up the game again and my friends and I have been having a blast!  [h1]Review of Don't Starve Together[/h1] [u][b]DISCLAIMER![/b] This Review Was Made On 08/18/2016[/u]  Don't Starve Together is a game all about, well, not starving together... or not buring to death during summer together... or not being eaten by a giant one-eyed bird... or not being mauled to death by a pack of ravenous hounds together... Look you get the point. It's a game all about using teamwork to survive in the evil world that Maxwell has created for Wilson in Don't Starve.  Teamwork can be very helpful but at the same time it can tear you apart. You will eventually run out of food, and when you do, you are bound to turn on your friends and blaim them for ""taking"" the food for themselves.  The gameplay of Don't Starve Together is almost exactly the same as in Don't Strave, except this time around there are new items to use that benefit your friends and yourself in the longrun.   Working as a team in the world of Don't Starve makes the game a hell of a lot easier for you, being able to have one person go out and get berries as you chop down wood greatly increases your chance of survival. The only thing wrong with working together is sharing of resources. This causes you to have to go out and get more food fast so you... Don't Starve. The only way to be sure that you don't fully run out of food is by raising the regrowth rate of plants and by raising the level of berries and carrots that will spawn.  [h1]Summary[/h1] Overall, Don't Starve is a great game for anyone who is looking for a fun yet hard survival game. It is also good for anyone who was a fan of the original Don't Starve.  One key point to note is that, you can play Don't Starve Together alone, making it almost the same as the base game.  It is also important to note that Reign of Giants is free with Don't Starve together. This doesn't mean that you will get if for Don't Starve as well, you'll still have to buy it separately. But honestly who cares, just buy Reign of Giants too. Klei is a great company that makes great games, so why not support them in any way possible.  I give Don't Starve Together a 10/10. It is a perfect game that deserves the overwhelmingly positive reviews that it is getting.  [h1][b]IMPORTANT FUTURE NOTE FOR DON'T STARVE TOGETHER![/b][/h1]  The Shipwrecked DLC that was released for Don't Starve is not currently part of Don't Starve Together but it most likely will be in the next few months (or at least by 2017 hopefully).  It is also important to note that all future DLC for Don't Starve will not be available for Don't Starve Together until months after it is released for Don't Starve. [b]So if they release a DLC for Don't Starve that adds more pets and monsters in the month of March, don't expect it to come out until around October of the same year for Don't Starve Together.[/b]",1471543849,True

76561197969385956,"There are times I'm loving this game and there are times I'm groaning in boredom or frustration with this game. It takes a game or two to grasp the basics. Once you get the idea down though it's a fairly easy [strike]to play[/strike] to know what to do.  Find food. Find rocks. Find wood. Make tools. Build a camp site.   After that?  Explore. Advance your camp site with things you find. Find or build additional methods of gathering food. Build things to defend yuorself with when fights happen.  The problem with this game mostly comes with death. When you die you turn into a ghost and watch as your body poofs into a skeleton and drops your intire inventory on the ground for you to fetch when you return alive. The long trip back to the spawn tends to be the largest issue for me. If you went miles out to explore new area you have to walk - as a ghost - miles back to the spawn where you started the game. There you resurect in a new body, and then you walk miles back to the place you died and collect your old inventory - stopping for nights of course since travel during night kills you (again). And then miles back to get home again - with night as downtime again. Death is [b]expensive[/b] in terms of time.  If you happened to die in Winter you'll never make it back to camp since you don't come back to life with a thermal stone (an item that keeps you from freezing to death during Winter). And you can't make a thermal stone on the spot. You need ingredients for it. Which you don't start with. you have no time to get these ingredients either since you start freezing only five steps into the cold. Unless you built your camp right at the spawn or you had the foresight to set up a stone-liked campfire and some wood (and possibly a thermal stone) at the spawn you're likely perminantly dead if you die in Winter.  Death is unforgiving as well. each time you die your max HP lowers. Why they thoguht that was a good idea baffles me. If you couldn't survive with 150 HP you know you won't survive with a max HP of 30 (about 2 hits if you wear armor). This isn't unfixable. You can craft booster shots that refill the max little by little. But you have to get the ingredients for these from monsters which have a possibility of lowering your max HP further.  But I have a theory that making death so harsh makes you as a player strongly favor survival over taking a chance. And it brings players to strongly desire working as a team over being greedy by knowing you'll need the help of others to safely build booster shots and help when death becomes imminent. I won't lie though; the times I have to spend 11 minutes over a corpse run are times I start thinking it'd be more fun to play something else.  The best part of the game is when you start putting together a pretty awesome camp. The feeling of accomplishment is powerful. Having nearby allies against attacks, a reliable food source, a stockpile of tools and replacements, and pure desire to see what else is out there with your friend(s).  The art style of the game originally threw me. I probably would have tried it sooner than I did if it didn't have the clunky paper drawing look. But after actually trying the game it struck me kinda cute and quirky. the characters to choose from leave me wondering if they were programmed correctly though. One says they're comfortable in darkness but their sainity drops like any of the others does soon as night time pops.  I can't help but feel the downsides of this game will be fixed up in time.

I've bought the game numerous times as gifts for other people, including my own daughter (we even did a version of Hard Knock Life (It's a Don't Starve Life) about the game. I rarely if ever buy a game more than once and for more than one console, unless I LOVE a game. I dare say I will still be playing this game when I'm a dottering old grandmother. Telling my grand kids..now THIS..this is how you make a good game. Watch and learn kids..watch and learn.  Highly recommended!",1484599745,True

76561197994613719,As someone who hasn't played the single player version that much I still wholeheartedly recommend this game.   You are going to get the most out of it with at least three friends. Talking and planning is essential here – maybe you will see your buddies in a new light after a few hours of a desperate battle against the many odds the game throws against you.   Beware: human emotions tend to go haywire in dangerous situations. You'll know what I mean if you ever built – what you thought was – a reasonably stable ecosystem only to completely be bamboozled by some irresponsible action of a friend.  Life will be tough but it's addicting. Especially together!  + realistic simulation of being lost in the wildernis with your friends. (=you die) + lovely graphics + the well goes deep: there's much to explore + endless replayability + intuitive gameplay (this one's a must) + stuff gets patched and refined regularly + you can burn forests!  - main menu is a bit confusing to use with the controller - you may lose a friend or two - you can burn your camp  Nomitated this game for the “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.,1477409146,True

76561198061597401,"Hiya, today im giving a review on the game, Don't Starve Together. This game has its pros and cons of course, like any other game I will honestly rate it!  Don't Starve Together is a game currently in Beta made off the game Don't Starve, you must survival the dark and twisted world. Weird giants and creatures all around, harsh weather conditions, the horrid wave of hounds you always forget about until you see the words, ""The hounds are baying!"" This game is definitly a game you want to try with friends or maybe on your own, you work together or not, and attempt survival. It is difficult at first to be honest, but as the game goes on it gets alot better :)  Pros~ Character Variety(Workshop Aswell) Art style Voices are instruments Never ending Laughs and scares for all X3 A fun coop game  Cons~ Can be very difficult at times Hackers do exist Furries on Workshop Everything will kill  To sum up the game, I'd give it a 9/10, I play it with my friend Tori all the time and it's always fun, never ever do we get tired of playing it. We suck so we usually cheat. I don't like the hounds but you can turn them off, now they have gifts :D And the game gets better and better after each update :)  Buy it even if it isn't on sale, I bought the 4 pack and gave some to friends to play. You won't regret this purchase at all :)",1452933159,True

76561198037044417,"A little weird to me that you either wait for the launch of this game to get don't starve together, or get a free copy of it at launch when you own the game. These games typically are a bit weird because you never get an unfinished copy of it until it's done. However it is a quirky little fun game that's 2D. Typical old school point and click type game for movement where you point and click on floor. Movement is a weird because of the graphics and the character gets stuck or has problems moving around things at times in order to pick things up. Could use more work. The devs actually put out updates and fix things. They have been timely with caring and tending for their game. This is your typical survival game. You can actually beat it in adventure mode but it is very short and not much gameplay is offered there.   You can build but it is very limitted. No roof's or shelters for you either. You can make things like umbrellas but you will never have true shelter other than building a fence. The fences are not durable and there are no gates available. It's a chore constantly breaking things to get in and out of your fenced area. Storage isn't good. Crafting storage takes a lot of wood and offers very little space. You end up crafting 30 or more just to keep your things stored. You can't really build too much and you can't rely on farming because in the winter nothing grows. You can survive from animals you hunt or stored rabits as well as other things here and there like birds. Provided, that you prepared and stocked up on items to survive. The game offers seasons which may or may not make things a tad more difficult due to weather changing.   Food will spoil quickly even in a craftable ice box. I suggest storing rabits with traps you made to catch them in storage chests so you can avoid the spoiling of food through the winter. Each storage chest can hold up to only 9 items. The idea is get what you can and survive while preparing for winter. Collect and gather resources and craft items to survive or play adventure mode and survive. At night if no light is made by you, you will die and just about anything else can kill you as well. Fun for a few hours but not enough to keep you busy for months. I pop in and out of it as new things become available.   Several mods for this edition of the game as well as the original version of the game. Recommended for short gaming sessions for those who want a much easier and funnier survival game. There are ways to avoid death by crafting armor or touching a touching stone or getting supplies to make magic items non stop that can aid you to stay alive. But if not prepapered you will die and have to restart your game again as there is perma death. However in this version of the game you can come back to life if you have your settings set for that.   This version is almost the same as the original version of the game but allows for playing with other people you pick or with randoms. You can very easily play with other people with little to no hassle or set up on your end. You do not need to deal with port forwarding settings which makes this co-op experience more attractive to newbies. Their wiki for the game is a bit weird to use and no search bar is even provided so I suggest just reading forums or talking with their community for help or ideas. Although it is not really needed as they game shows you what you can and can not craft. Making it so much easier rather than playing a survival game where you have to be glued to a wiki page because the game failed at teaching you anything or showing you what you could and couldn't do. I am really liking the games that clearly show you what is going on and what you can make. Enjoy! :)",1420995362,True

As much as you want to be able to explore and do your own thing each day in game you find that you are in essense just ruled by the clock. There is always stuff that has to be done each day and there simply isn't enough time to get it all done even with extra people helping. There is a constant pressure of everything being required to prevent death.  - Need wood constantly because if you are in darkness at night you die. But of course you can't just go out and chop wood all day cause it pisses off the tree guardian then you've gotta spend a bunch of time dealing with that guy. - Need to gather or work on growing/cooking food because without food you'll die and pretty fast. And you've got to cook the food or you get nearly nothing for sustanance from eating it. - Need to search for other resources constantly to build weapons and gear that help ease the burden of your daily tasks. And protect yourself from the elements. Also your tools break so fast that 30% of what you gather goes towards the cost of crafting the items you need for gathering. - Need a stock of weapons and armor (which wear out really fast) because every few days the hounds attack or some other monster. - Have to go out and keep the local spider nests oppressed regularly because if you don't a spider queen will spawn and basically just kill you with ease then next time you try to go get some webs. - Need to also gather matierals for warm clothes and a stock pile of food in time for winter because you can't venture out too far or you will freeze to death unless you have warm cloths or warm rocks (that need to be recharged and replaced regularly). - Need to constantly monitor your sanity. Can't explore too much or see too much action in a short time and you have to sleep enough each day because if you don't you go insane. The only cure is taking a bunch of time to pick flowers, find and eat mushrooms...etc essentially wasting a bunch of time that you don't have cause winter is coming FAST!  ...and the list goes on. You are constantly under the gun of having to get 24 hours of crap done in 12 and just when you think you're ahead the game throws you a curve ball that completely ruins ya. After a while it just started feeling like work to me and the game was stressing me out more than it was entertaining me.  Yes there are lots of mods that allow you to control these aspects but I find that you really need to spend some time finding a good balance because when you stop all the need for the plate spinning you realize how dull the game actually is. The constant plate spinning distracts you from realizing there really isn't anything all that engaging on fun going on in the game - there's no story line or end game and once you've gone through the whole cycle of a year and explored the varied biomes there really isn't anything new to see.",1502865433,False

Make sure to cut the trees with two branches at the top. -Be careful on what character you choose as they all have flaws but the best to start with is Wilson. -Always have some extra food on you. You'll never know when someone desperatly needs food. -Green Mushrooms are very good if you are low on sanity. Make sure too cook them though! -The best area to put a base in is near Beefalo  and a road for quick travel. -You do not have to fight spiders to get their silk/glands. Simply lure them into a trap and you get the resources trouble free! -Another say way of getting meat is by going near Moles, putting rocks/flint on the floor and waiting til they go out. Then attack them and you get a morsel without risk! -Treeguards can be be calmed by planting saplings of their trees near them. -Be careful when choosing Webber, as pigs will attack you on sight and you have lower sanity.

I never would've imagined its [i]Minecraft[/i]-like survival mechanics could actually improve with friends and family. [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] proves it does.  My wife and I were both big [i]Don't Starve[/i] fans by ourselves and [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] gave us the chance to thrive or die as one couple against the world. Like a real marriage, but with lots of weird, moody pets and no life insurance. It was love at first sight and our favorite multiplayer experience so far.  It includes all of the original game's DLC (except [i]Shipwrecked[/i], but similar seafaring mechanics have been implemented recently). That means all the crafting, the fighting and the conflict is here, only now it's a shared experience. Play with friends in your local network or against Steam members from all over the world. If you want, you can still play alone as well, but why would you? Seasonal and special events like [i]The Forge[/i] and [i]The Gorge[/i] are better enjoyed with people you know. It's also great to see what combination of characters you and your friends will pick to play together. Who will go for the legacy group (Wilson, Willow, Maxwell...) and who will pick one of the newbies (Wortox, Wormwood, Wurt...)?  While Klei didn't get around to making achievements for it, which I would've liked, they've managed to get me addicted with the game's skin drops. Collecting clothes, trading them, weaving them from discarded items and personalizing my character suddenly became just as important as keeping it alive.  Need another reason to play [i]Don't Starve Together[/i]? When you buy one, you get a free copy for a friend! Even better, if you owned the original before [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] was released, like I did, you may already own it for free!

76561198042765226,"The following is just a quick overview of the game for a full review check out my website at http://ausiejamster.wix.com/ausiesgamingzone#!dont-starve-together/ccpz  Don't Starve Together is a Co-Op/PvP survival game with the ability to be online or off. It is a multi-player remake of the original 'Don't Starve' game. Featuring most of the original content and characters, yet it doesn't include caves as well as the Reign of Giants downloadable content that the original 'Don't Starve' offers. Don't Starve Together is exclusive available on PC and purchasable from the steam store. I think the game's graphics are very good, I love the art-style and the polished content. The audio soundtracks are pretty decent, but aren't really to my style, although, it does suit the art-style of the game. The SFX, however, are amazing for the art-style, showing game designers that reaching out of the main stream sounds can still set a pretty decent scene, while adding to the player experience. It doesn't really have a story, however, you can easily extend the story from the original 'Don't Starve' Game. The game's content however doesn't have a massive downfall because of the lack of story as Klei Entertainment continuously update the game showing they do really care about it. The controls are pretty straight forward and decent with enough buttons to do what you want to do without having to try too hard, making the game easy to pick up. The difficulty of the game, I think is very solid not to hard but also not to easy, giving the game a lot of play time. There is some strategy to the game allowing the player to select the way they would like to produce their living essentials and whether it is stable in all seasons. There is no competitive side on this game at the moment, although, this might change in the future as Klei Entertainment is playing around with the PvP content. Overall I would give the game a score of 8.5/10 I do really think this game can have a lot of success in the future (as it is still in early access).",1426824872,True

I have a strategy for bases, though-  Like, I recommend you find the following three things -Beefalo, for manure and fur. also horns and meat. -Spiders, for silk. Monster meat can also be useful -Gold rocks/boulders. What more can I say? You need gold for a LOT of things.  I say, you should get this game, at least if it's your type of thing.

I think there could be something like a, ""reignition""or something like that. This could be an event where Battlemaster Pugna could return to the battleground.

76561198047832583,"The single player Don't Starve became stale for me after about 50 hours, so I was very excited when DST was released.   It is an unforgiving survival game, with unique mechanics (such as weather and sanity levels) that keep me busy even at 150 hours of gameplay.  The developers keep updating the game and there is so much content now with the addition of the cave system and Reign of Giants.   It is very funny too at times, like when your friend dies in a silly way or when friends don't appreciate how dangerous a fire staff can be and wave it around camp almost burning the whole place down twice.

I more than recommend playing with others you know, because if game-anonymity has taught me anything, it can be a mixed bag with regards to who you'll be playing with.  With this, now you can laugh, cry, and otherwise have a few buddies experience the same things you do.  That being said, I'm using my previous review:  ---  Don't Starve and Dwarf Fortress share one thing in common; losing is fun!  The game itself is a huge learning experience, and you'll always get further (usually) the last time than you did the first time.  Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.  It's brutal at first glance, but even after you get better; the game doesn't stop getting harder.  If anything, the longer you live, the more merciless nature itself gets.

76561198025582767,"The game is fine, if you want to play on dedicated servers, but if you were planning on just playing a hosted game with your friends, the game has serious technical problems that seriously impact its playability, especially long term. There are serious and inexplicable problems with graphical and server lag that have not been adequately addressed by the developer, more than a year after launch. Bugs abound with display options. The longer you play, the more likely these fun sucking bugs will arise, and the more serious their impact can become.  I get that Klei is working on these issues, but some of these issues have been around since the Beta. It's beginning to look like they simply aren't able to resolve them, either through a lack of technical expertise or simply the limitations of their implementation. This is a terrible shame, because the game, when it's playable, is very enjoyable, but the fruits of your labor (sustained survival) is punished by unbearable lag and unexplanable choppy frame rates.  Add in that the developers have made needless changes to characters and items from Don't Starve (such as major nerfs to characters and inexplicably adding durability mechanics to the Thermal Stone), the use of mods, even unstable and incomplete versions, is necessary to restore Don't Starve Together to Don't Starve multiplayer, as it was originally marketed.  Lucky for me, I got DST free, since I owned Don't Starve before DST was released. Had I known when I bought it what I know now, I probably wouldn't have bought Don't Starve Together for my friend, however.  Buyer beware.  TLDR: It's fun. It's addictive. It's a hot mess of 2 year old bugs. Last two days, I've spent more time researching how to deal with the fun sucking lag than actually enjoying the game. If Klei can resolve the lag issues for Hosted games, I'd whole heartedly recommend it. As it is? Can't do it.  PS - Before you leave a typical stupid comment about my machine... The game ""lags"" while my computer is only at 60% RAM resources and 40% processor usage, and this is with browsers, Discord, AV running on Windows 10. My computer can run MUCH more resource intensive games (like WatchDogs, Guild Wars 2, and Saints Row III and IV) on maximum settings. It isn't my PC. There's some kind of memory leak. I found that logging out of Windows, then logging back in restores smooth gameplay, despite the large number of beasties and other junk spawned in the world, even, again, while running browsers, Discord, and AV on Windows 10.  It's good/bad. If you don't mind frequent reboots/relogs on Windows, it's fine.  PPS - Overall, the game is fun. It's addictive, though it eventually runs its course, but all games do. There are many worse games to spend $15 on. Sadly, however, it's very hard to find anyone that actually plays it vanilla (without mods), because the game, as it's put together, is frustrating and designed to basically to kill you. Unmodded, this punishes long term play on established servers (that and the sheer number of monsters would crash most servers within weeks, if not days). Recommended? Yes. With caveats.

Nice enough, with different graphics and be good enough to reflect the atmosphere of the game in my eyes +1 launches add points.The game is not 2D.We can't say that is actually fully 3D.So like 2.5 D. As a result, it perfectly suits a game like this the graphics.  Gameplay- At first I thought it would be less of the content.Then when you craft something,do new things, they do thrive as it evolves and you want to make it better.The control system is quite simple; Motion and interference. but it's good enough for this game.As for the crafting system... The crafting system in this game is really burdensome to you to explain it a little by trying to find out more fun for you and is curious. Co-Op- Together with your friends and if you have enough of your friends if it is ok. Track of time I'll tell you that we passed.

76561197963203759,"One of my most favourite games of all time. A fantastic survival challenge game that I return to again and again because of the depth and variety of gameplay mechanics. There is enough depth to the game that you can adopt a variety of different playstyles to succeed at the same tasks; you aren't chained to any one strategy (or the same way everyone else does) to get shit done.  Don't Starve rewards the player's experience level and ability to strategize and innovate/come up with new tactics. Like TFC, the longer you play the game, the more tidbits of knowledge you accrue, and the more u can combine that info to exploit a game system in a newer, more clever/efficient manner, which is awesome!  The first few hundred hours will be spent learning the game and how to survive. Once you have the basics down, there's whole worlds (Overworld and Underworld) of different challenges you can tackle. If you have the imagination, creativity and drive, the end game can consist of countless hours designing and constructing your own custom base, as beautiful or efficient as you'd like it to be.  Don't Starve Together allows you to do this with the benefit (or curse) of playing this game with friends or strangers, in a variety of manners (casually, co-op challenge, or pvp) which only adds to the already insane base of replayability options that Don't Starve already offers.  The fact that Klei (so far) has proven to be a solid indie studio with integrity, and a proven track record of fun, well-designed games with good production quality, along with their decision to maintain and build on their game by putting out a constant stream of content in various updates has only served to continue to breathe new life into this game and keep Don't Starve Together as a constantly fresh & fun gameplay experience.  So far Klei has been my best experience with a video game studio (which is saying a lot. I've had some pretty BAAAD ones in my time), so my sincere hope is that they'll not grow too big, too fast, and be able to continue to treat their community well and reward them with a continual stream of fresh, quality content and games.

But at some point a griefer came in, waited till the night is several seconds to end, and set everything on fire, the base, forest, everything (and, additionally, summoned a lot of tentacles on the base, but whatever). People voted to restore previous save, but it didn't help since the saves are made simply at start of the day. We've just saved! We tried loading it again but it's the same save, the same day, and it's not possible to choose day. So the game is corrupted. Anti-griefer system doesn't work. We've got our world broken by a griefer, forever. We started a new world, survived 15 days, and the same guy (with different nickname) joined. And did the same exact thing again, when night is almost ended... He has set everything on fire, and summoned tentacles, again. Another corrupted world, again. What do we do? He outsmarted your simple anti-grief system. My suggestion here - to be able to choose how far you want to rollback.  P.S.

From me not understanding how to find flint to being chased from the Ent like tree monsters all the way to freaking out yelling when the atomsphere before the hounds came ( [strike] I haven't died to bees yet I dont see the big deal [/strike] ) my gaming experiance has been a great joy. I even went to purchase the single player editon and all the DLC in hopes to get a better understanding and beat my record of surviving 15 days (God this guy is such a noob!)   10/10 I would recommend this!

76561198122541900,"A truely amazing sandbox/survival game. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. Even though I have not played the original Dont Stave I found that it did not present a steep learning curve however one may want to refer to game guides if you are not familiar with survival based games or when one reaches the more advanced sections in the game such as the winter or crafting  complicated items.   Not only is it a constant battle for food, you will need to keep yourself sane as you battle against the elements, fight the savage wilderness and strange creatures that roam the land. Stay out of the dark as Charlie haunts the pitch shroud  at night and one would need to be strategic while preparing for the winter as it only gets tougher to survive. The experience and atmostsphere is only enhanced by the drawn style graphics which closely resemble the works of Tim Burton (Creator of The Nightmare Before Christmas and other movie titles.).  One could say that there are elements present that are Minecraft inspired however stating that this game is anything close to Minecraft would be completely incorrect as I believe this game is very original in it's own right.  Second of all this game offers so much fun and stability for an early access game it is defintely worth it. To be entirely honest this game does not feel like an early access beta at all. Very little lag is experienced during gameplay, it is well optimized for a beta version and I have not experienced any game breaking bugs nor have I encountered a single game crash as of yet.  Pros: + Runs like a beauty (No need for a beefy computer). + Huge replayability (With the addition of mods to make it even more interesting or challenging.) + Many customizable options for maps (Amount of resources, enemies, size, etc.). + Creating servers is simple and quick. + Simple controls.  Cons: + When hosting a sever with 6 or more players the game tends to lag slightly. (A dedicated server will probably fix this issue.) + No in-game tutorial for the begginers to DST who have not played the orignal DS.   Unfortunately controller / gamepad is still not available to use in this DST however I cannot classify this as a con as it is a matter of preference wether you prefer to play with a key board and mouse or a gamepad however if you prefer a gamepad then this would be a con.  On a final note there is nothing more satisfying than playing this game with a couple of friends, I have found this game to be truely rewarding and can be enjoyed for hours.   I am extremely happy with the money I have spent and would recommend this anyone looking for a co-op survival game.",1420245075,True

76561198186144443,"Overall a nice endless survival game I fell in love with right off the bat. An utterly amazing draft, stunning graphics, inscrutable mechanisms, challenging seasons, perfect crafting and balanced items, which are not exceedingly overpowered nor good-for-nothing.  Every world is randomly generated making each save original, generally urging to explore new biomes, enemies, plants and so on.  It does not go without saying that such a venerable looking game tries to bring you to knees at any circumstances. It may sound hilarious at first, yet come think of it all the insidious traps, hideous bosses and even the environmental mechanics make your game experience utterly unbearable. Even though the game name might seem to introduce you to the main problem, in the end, starvation is the last thing to kill you.  It might look like a very onerous trifle from the get-go, but do not hesitate to keep trying, because you will eventually favour and adore this game in the very end. From that being said, it is crucial to realize that this (together) edition was made to be played with 1-5 additional players, and is therefore composed for multiplayer experience only. It should be fairly obvious for you, now,  why the pause button does not actually seem to be working even when playing as a host on your own without anyone else. For singleplayer experience, seek the original (non-together) edition, which is easier and more balanced for only one player.  Keep in mind, that this (together) edition has the Reign of Giants downloadable content permanently toggled on, whereas in the original (non-together) edition can be switched not only between the Reign of Giants but also between Vanilla and Shipwrecked content, which still has not been implemented into this (together) edition.  Last but not least, the community is completely astonishing. New characters, items, dishes, animations; and simply extraordinary mods are created on a pretty much daily basis. Lastly, since 2016, this game has been getting plenty of brand new updates including special events, mechanics, items and bosses.  To cut a long story short, I shall give this game 9.5/10 for not having the same downloadable and workshop content as the (non-together) edition yet.",1456313702,True

76561197975346239,"If you've played the original Don't Starve and have been aching to play it with your friends, or random people, I highly recommend this game. This game is a lot of fun when it's played with friends because you guys get to decide on what type of adventure you guys want to get yourselves into because you can edit the world to your liking. Whether it be a world with scarce resources, monster-filled environments, or with just plain, set-to-default settings, it's still very fun! As a veteran player, I really like jumping into random games people host because I like to ""observe"" what the other veterans do (like hunting Koalefants/Tallbirds for their meats) and what the new players are trying to do (like killing five spiders, two of which are Spider Warriors, with a pickaxe), which, I have to admit, is very entertaining the majority of the time. There are some times, ESPECIALLY when the Winter season comes, where you just wish everyone that joined the game you're in knows what they're doing, or just able to ""pull their weight,"" because of scarce resources (many people make all sorts of personal tools and gear without gathering the materials themselves) and constantly dwindling food supplies (too many mouths to feed and not enough hunters). However, when your whole team DOES manage to make it past the first winter season, it's a very satisfying accomplishment.  If all of what I previously said doesn't sound very appealing to you, then don't bother with the game. Frankly, if you like making a base JUST for YOURSELF, not liking the idea of being with other players, or just being antisocial in general, then you really wouldn't like the multiplayer addition to Don't Starve; this game is meant to be played with other people and working TOGETHER with said people (hence the emphasis on TOGETHER for DST's teaser), so you're seriously better off playing vanilla if you're just going to be antisocial in a social game. I don't want to sound mean, but it's the truth (at least it is for me).  Even though the game is still in its Beta phase, it's very playable; the devs have done a great job so far and the updates just keep rolling in with fixes. Get it if you really want it, but if you can wait, then I recommend waiting for its official multiplayer release (around summer), of which is included (I THINK) in the original Don't Starve.",1422349616,True

Cons: *Can get kinda laggy (and thus, frustrating) if you're playing as a guest and your connection (or the host's one) is not the best. *Better with friends for most people. *The game COULD overwhelm you at the start since it's got many items, crafting recipes and etc.  And I can't think of other cons!

Every aspect of combat is swing, back away, swing, back away, you never really have much sense of progression as you play, as in, you could play for a week straight have every item and be master of your domain, but yet you still gain little to no advantage in combat and so the enemies never become a fair fight.

It has artistic elements reminicent of Tim Burton's style; rough pen designs, a dark and limited color palette, with odd and disproportionate bodies, characters and monsters, which work to set the tone. Unfortunately some of the art assets don't scale well on higher resolutions, perhaps a redux or texture rework would improve such, although this contributes to the fact that it works pretty well on most machines regardless of specification, even providing a netbook mode for such hardware.  There are many elements to the survival, producing a somewhat steep learning curve.

You go around places, harvest things to help you build tools to survive, or grab a weapon and start hacking away at animals for food ( or grow your own veggies and cook them in a crockpot ).   The fact that this game allows modding is perfect, because it allows you to play a wider cast of characters this way, and lets you bring in certain mechanics and items that the game alone doesn't offer.

It is too difficult for a person who has no experience with coding, and I will probably never be able to make one, but that is alright because there are many creators out there who like to do so anyways!

Well, it's a very different survival game, great art design, great multiplayer, tradable items, you can play this game on single player mode with no problems, good lore, awesome characters, awesome boss fights, awesome items, you can run this game on a potato, but like all games, Don't Starve Together have some issues, most of them are related to the community and not the game it self.   Well one of the bigest issues is that most of the players are stupid noobs, and it seems that they never learn how to play, they're stuck in this infinte stupid noob loop, always making the same stupid mistakes and never learning anything from them. The other issue is the stupid workshop mods, most of them are stupid mods that makes the game very easy or its a stupid anime character mod. When you are going to play in a stupid public server, people use a stupid list of 99999999999999 stupid mods that make the gamer easy and adds a lot of stupid anime characters.

Simple mechanics  Cons: Battle mechanics a bit oversimplistic The game punishes you for your mistakes (not necessarily bad, but I imagine new players have a hard time adapting) Could have a bit of a story to it, so you have a quest and not just strivig to survive  My wishes (improvements I guess) Adding even more to multiplayer what is already available in single player (like they did with caves and Reign of Giants DLC, which is DST is based on). What I mean by this is add more levels to the caves, have a chance to randomly find a pirate ship on the map which would then transport you to the Shipwrecked world (kind of like caves work).

I can't be sure which items, characters, and enemies have been added since the original release of Dosn't Starve, as I like to discover these in-game rather than read about them online. I feel safe to assume that the cartographer's desk only became useful with the addition of multiplayer. Map creation appears to allow the choice between classic Don't Starve and the new additions of Don't Starve Together.  I recieved this version free because I already owned the base game.

After I figured out how to cut trees and build a base, a magnificient, huge and friendly Deerclops poped-up out of nowhere... Don't worry, we had a great time around my campfire(or what was left of that campfire) and we played hide and seek all the night. He managed to find me in every corner of the map; it was fun, though, it was like I had a second Chester but a little bit bigger. Me and my friends had great time in this game. I like how every creature in this game automatically dislikes you and wants to kill you or steal from you(I look at you, Cave monkeys and Krampusse!). I think some of them are a little too overpowered(Dragonfly, Toadstool, Bee Queen) but that's the fun of the game. I highly recommend this game because you learn what really teamwork is and you don't need a high-end pc to run it. I have a ten years old pc and this game never crashed or stayed below 50 fps.

76561198112375009,"Don't Starve Together is a potentially wonderful game with an inventive art style and simplistic motives. It has a relatively interesting take to keep yourself invested. The main idea is to run around gathering resources and fending for oneself with whatever your main character has.  It's generally a struggle at the start, but with teamwork it can alter a bit to be easy. Or if you know what the hell you're doing by yourself to begin with and didn't just jump in to be breast fed by a pro player it could be easy too... But I digress!    I would recommend it months ago when I had first gotten into it, but as of lately, I've gotten a tiny bit apprehensive to the newest changes to the game. Not because it is a struggle to play said game. On the very contrary! It's mostly how easy it is.    I'll list the changes that have made the most impact to the gameplay for myself. I am going over what made the strongest impact, and not the full thing. I may add later, but for now, it'll be limited:   >Haunting Destruction Removed:    At first, the most understandable change that had occurred were stopping the rapid fires in Don't Starve Together. I am not saying bring back the fires. No one wants a raging loon taking revenge for not housing them by dying and then setting fire to the world. That's no good. It can ruin someone's gameplay at times, which is understandable. But I'd like to bring a point across. To others, this is a bit upsetting and made the gameplay seem not worth the try, but to myself, it added to my own interest.  I liked the _unexpected_ challenge I had. It made me prepare for the problem prior, and made myself feel a little bit challenged after I've understood the way to handle the mess from replay of said experience. And if you want replay, you want challenges and unfortunately, a chaotic unexpected player is a challenge. It made the community more interesting and had grabbed me to help out after an incident occur. Without them, I don't feel so inclined.   >Caves    Caves are great. Caves are always a challenge to work through and live in. Everything in them is basically a ticking time bomb. If I had to say anything of said game aspect, it'd be for more of this. Not enough players go underground and you can avoid it if you really want to, so it can be a bit of a bore by yourself. But the importance is that the caves work. I want more troubles you can't account for. More ways to survive and not survive all wrapped in one. I don't want my adventure to be easy. I want it to be fun.   >Touch Stone Regeneration   Originally, Touch Stones were a one time use. If you used it once, you better make it worth it, especially in Survival. Now, it makes any challenges in Don't Starve Together boring. Everyone lives near the touch stone now. It makes the challenge nonexistent unless you happen to die in a far location, but if you live near your resource to reviving, nine out of the ten times you're going to make the walk to it because you're glued to the spot you live in.  Now I can hear it, don't live near it, but eh, I want to play Don't Starve Together with strangers and have fun. I can't have fun if we're doing the same boring method after the same boring method.   So in conclusion, what I really want this game to do is expand on ways to struggle in game. Make me say, ""man, I am not going to last at this rate!"" instead of, ""I wonder how else this is going to be too easy in the future."" I like some changes here and there. It makes it interesting. As long as it is a challenge that feels like one. If I can walk away and not become involved in a problem, it can be a bit boring.      ",1478231849,True
76561198253803400,"Don't starve already turned out to become one of my most well-loved games and Don't Starve together just took that love to a whole new level. The game sat on my wishlist and inventory for a long time due to a lack of people to play it with. Tonight, however, I was able to finally give it a shot and all I can say is that I absolutely loved it. I even love it more than the original. While both games are beautifully crafted with magnificent art and clever mechanics, the challenging aspects of Don't starve that everyone falls in love with just gets better and more enjoyable when you have someone to do it with.  Just as being alone in the woods for the original can cause serious ramifications on your sanity and can be considered a very unique metaphor for real life and its loneliness, Don't Starve Together just proves that some things are better together! The woods seem less lonely, the tasks are more manageable and of course, survival becomes monumentally more natural.

76561198243602898,"One of the best games I ever played. 9/10  The game itself has a challenging yet adequate learning curve and plenty of content to discover. Overall the community is friendly and inclusive, definitely best played with friends.  The first few games feel like everything is out to kill you (because it is), and you get a nice adrenaline kick just from frantically trying to survive and loads of laughs as you die in the most unimaginable ways. As you get more experienced and basic survival is no longer a challenge (took me about 30 hours for the novelty of survival to wear off), you'll start planning a bit further and preparing for each season's harsh climate conditions and bosses.   This is when the real game starts and the importance of long term planning, working well with others and managing time and resources effectively become more obvious. It's no longer a matter of surviving, it's a matter of doing it in the most ingenious way possible by combining and interacting the different elements of the game.   e.g.: Frog rain in spring? Certain death for some, free food for others.  Even when you are familiar with the above ground map's climate conditions, biomes, mobs and resources, there is still a lower level (Caves) to explore, which adds an extra layer of complexity and adventure to the game.   As if these incredibly addictive and time consuming aspects of the game weren't enough, there's yet another level which I am just starting to explore which are the Ruins of which I've only seen a couple of mobs and resources despite having played for over 200 hours.  The only thing that I believe can be improved (hence the 9/10 rating) is that other than autumn, all other seasons can be quite un-welcoming to both new and experienced players alike, so you're much more likely to (be left to) die when joining a server during winter or summer.  My favourite aspect of DST, is that it delivers these challenging mechanics and interactions through hilarious visuals and dark sarcasm, which will inevitably make you laugh even in the most difficult situations.",1477668360,True

76561198311993104,"Don't Starve Together is a really great game, it's like Don't Starve all over again, but this time with friends!  You may think playing with friends is easier, but it makes everything so much harder! Firstly, you need more food to feed yourselves. Secondly, people may (sometimes) want to PvP, even in other servers, like what happened to me...I died because they saw that I was a noob and decided to kill me multiple times for fun. Thirdly (the worst), because you may be playing with friends, the monsters' health are increased drastically! EVEN if you are playing single player mode! This makes the game all the more difficult, and fun for you and your friends, and is also a great test of your teamwork, patience, and your friendships >:D  However, they decided to make other aspects of the game easier and more fun: -You can play ANY character, even Maxwell from the beginning! (Don't Starve needed you to unlock each character by earning enough EXP, which takes a TON of time) -There are new items and other stuff which are not available in DS -Multiplayer! (duh) More people means more challenges, and more challenges means more fun! (and raging) -Fun and challenging events such as The Forge, The Gorge, Year of the (Insert creature here) and lots more will keep you from getting bored and leave you with fresh challenges all-year-round!  This game can kill hours upon hours. As you play, the seasons will change, bringing you new challenges everytime, which may even kill inexperienced players (like me).However, with enough practice, you can surely master the game, and even go beyond just surviving, thriving! Just don't get cocky, even experienced players may screw up some time or another.  Lastly, purchasing this game will include another complementory copy, which can then be gifted to your friend, so they can play with you as well!  Overall, this game is REALLY worth the time and money, and can even keep you hooked for years!

Also lag issues most reviews mention are relics from last year and have been fixed.  I've been playing Don't Starve Together with my best friend in the US (I'm in AUS) for a few weeks now. We had played it about a year ago for a week or two as well.   1.) Content seems to encompass all of the vanilla game + the vast majority of RoG expansion, but does not include SW.  2.) I find with one other person the challenge is about identical or slightly harder than the single player experience.  3.) He hosts the server in US and I connect from AUS. I definitely have lag but rubberband only rarely. The lag is consistent but isn't actually noticeable until you're trying to kite fight monsters, you generally can get one less hit off than if you weren't lagging. The lag is smooth (if that makes sense) and doesn't feel bad (and I usually abhor even minor lag). Compared to a year or so ago rubberbanding is largely gone and lag is less of an issue.  4.) I didn't know dedicated servers were a thing as someone else mentioned in this thread, maybe that would solve the lag issues. Will have to try it out.  5.) Most mods I have tried in singleplayer work with Don't Starve Together as well. We use mostly basic mods like minimaphud, colored wormholes, alwaysshowvalues, etc.  6.) It is definitely a complete, challenging, and highly highly enjoyable game. I personally vastly prefer it to single player (which I love!) even despite my own lag issues.

The multiplayer is my first experience with this game & both the wife & I have spent a lot of time in game yelling, shrieking & laughing our butts off at various things in our attempts to tackle these randomly generated worlds!  EVERY game has been different.  While being wonderful to look at it's very easy to pick up & just start playing.  Fumble your way through the first few days & eventually things start just slotting into place.  Add a few survival  tips from the Don't Starve community & you might make it through the first Winter.  The best part of Don't Starve Together in my opinion are the constant suprises that just keep coming even after 30+ hours playing, whether its environmental, or little interactions between items you had not realised, new mobs or finding out you can feed a pig to make him your little buddy to help chop wood!

You're not only trying to survive but you're trying to beat your own preious goals each time you begin a new server. Every day that passes you and your friends scurry off trying to gather as many supplies for the winter (and days ahead) and hope that your base is in a safe enough spot.   The multiplayer element really makes the game just as enjoyable as the single player version. With friends you're able to set goals and tasks to each person and team up in combats. PVP is a ""hunger games"" like experience. Seeing another player is frightening but an opportunity to team up and take on the server.  Modding for this game is highly accessible and easy to implement. The host of each server controls modding, so whatever mods they have installed, they will be the only ones avalible to use. Un-modded servers are available, however if you havn't played the single player version of Don't Starve I wouldn't recommend joining any un-modded serves. The game requires some getting used to and practice.  As you explore this vast land you'll encounter creatures, friendly beasts, mysterious entities and wonderful and scary abilities of Mother Nature and the human body.

Between its vast majority of places to explore, character variety, and constant additions, the Don't Starve game series is one I'll never get tired of. Every game you join or world you create you discover something new, or are forced to play in a different way to adapt and survive.  Many survival games, once you get the hang of it, it doesn't stay much of a ""survival"" game. But with Don't Starve Together there are many situations that you may not expect to happen that can catch you off guard, such as the newer bosses constantly being added, getting ambushed while exploring the caves, or even just running out of resources forcing you to rely on your wits, instantly putting you back into the game.   The Klei developers themselves are also amazing people, I have seen them time and time again actually talk to those who play the game so people's voices are actually heard, and they are constantly adding new things to the game.

76561198048184220,"Welp, if you played original Don't Starve and have doubts wether or not you should buy this game, you should do it. it's fun, it has public servers so you can jump on other people's games, and if you play with friends it's really fun to have that feeling of surival with them.  But now with the cons. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS EARLY ACCESS AND THIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. But personally, i'm  not really fund of having this sensless survival. like, if you played original Don't Starve, there's at least an objective, something you have to do other than survive. but in this game it's simply...survive, or as the game says, Don't Starve. it might change in the future, but currently it hasn't .  and something that honestly ruins the experience is the whole ghosts thing. basically when other people die they turn into ghosts and even if they're really far away, it will slowly drain your sanity. and this bothers a lot specially in PvP servers. because what's the point of fighting everyone if after they die their ghosts will drain your sanity. so really, this would be a good idea, but only if ghosts are close to you not when they're 1000 miles away. but keep in mind this might be subject to change.  So why give this a good review with this specific cons? because the game's not completely finished. who knows, maybe in the future we will get objectives and the ghosts will be nerfed. but even if that doesn't happen, this game is fun to play from time to time and it can get pretty fun, specially when playing with friends.  as it is right now, I give this game 8/10",1420590673,True

While I think it's more enjoyable to play the co-op version with a friend, it doesn't mean the single player experience isn't worth checking out.  I haven't experienced co-op through the public roulette of open servers -- so I can't speak to the experience of finding a game and playing it that way.  If you do, just know that you'll need a solid chunk of time to devote toward getting futher in the game.

I love sandbox games with survival aspects, I do love 7 days to day, I enjoy Minecraft every now and then, but this game is just special. It is extremely hard at the beginning the game might seem very hard, almost impossible to survive (if you're not going through YouTube tutorials on how to survive, which I strongly recommend - finding everything out on yourself is half of the fun), but later on you'll get a grip of it. You might even survive the winter and then move on.  Now that was the description of classic single player don't starve - this one however's got Reign of Giants included, where spring is making you constantly wet, thus making you go insane, freezing and getting killed by enormous tornado attack ability having gooses... And that's considered a friendly season. It does make the game frustrating from time to time, but it's SO MUCH FUN'  TL;DR: You'll die a lot. You will have to learn a whole lot of things to do, to survive. You WILL die a lot. The game is gonna try to continuously make your life more and more miserable and you sure as hell WILL die a lot.

First and foremost, this game is really fun and enjoyable to play with friends. I remember when my brother showed me the single-player version of the game and I was so amazed. The graphics are very nice and fancy, the music is relaxing and depending on the situation it changes to match the 'background' . If you like survival games to play with friends, I definately recommend this game. On the other hand, once you get familiar with the game it starts to get boring and you can survive indefinately and once you collect most of the resources, build a base, explore the whole map (including caves) there is bassicaly nothing left to do.   Pros: -Really enjoyable with friends -Great music -Many customizations through workshop -Nice gameplay and mechanics Cons: -Poor online servers -Game gets boring after you get good at is since you can survive indefinately -Poor PVP (needs some gamemodes or something) This sums up my review, I hope you found it helpfull! :)  ",1510264158,True

76561198049611738,"Don't Starve was one of my favorite survival games when it came out, and multiplayer has breathed new life into a game I already adored. The addition of extra players, plus tweaking of existing mechanics balanced around multiplayer and an incentive to keep your companions alive, makes the game very fun and leads to a lot of memorable moments, especially with friends (like when they're insane and being attacked by monsters only they can see, and you're chasing them trying to force-feed them jerky to make them regain their sanity and make the monsters stop attacking).  If you enjoyed Don't Starve, and you have friends who also enjoy Don't Starve, this is great fun and I highly recommend it. If you want to play online without friends, do so at your own risk - the community is varied at best.  p.s. Connections can be finnicky at times, but the game is generally quite playable and rubberbanding is very uncommon. There's never any real desyncing issues with the host, and most mods work clientside and won't affect the host.",1433480230,True

It's awesome yet simultaneously annoying; you can bring giants to their knees but still die from a damned frog (if you don't play carefully). So basically it's an amazing game, especially for fans of the wilderness survival and crafting genre looking for unforgiving co-op play.",1471793733,True

The world has seasons and two of the seasons (Spring and Fall) are relatively easy to survive, while the other two seasons are more challenging (Summer and Winter). You need to spend your time wisely in Spring and Fall to make it through Summer and Winter. If you like survival games, you will likely enjoy this one. This game can be challenging at first, but stick with it! It's a lot of fun and its especially fun to play with friends.

76561198167755326,"Well, Don't Starve Together. I love this game, and I don't think I need to point out why, over 30 thousand people have already pointed it out. Impeccable music, unique and incredible art style, brutal yet rewarding gameplay. I have to say, it's hard to stop playing this game, and not in a Skinnerbox method, Candy Crush/WoW kind of ""I can't stop playing."" I'm a total survival + sandbox game junkie, and this fills both of those needs. It's hard for me to name a single problem with this game itself, but I'll get to the problems with it that aren't Klei's fault later on.   ---The Game Itself, and what it's like.--- The game is a blast, full of tough decisions, engaging gameplay, and stress. Lots of stress. Don't Starve Together has you managing a few main things, this being your HP, your Hunger, your Sanity, your temperature, your wetness, and probably most importantly, time. You need to go throughout the world, collecting any resource you can simply to survive. Survive intervals of hound attacks, which get more frequent as time goes on. Survive full moons, where normally friendly pigmen become ...werepigs. Spooky. You'll travel throughout an unforgiving world and eventually set up a camp where you can unlock new recipes to help you survive. Later on, winter will start. In this, plants grow more slowly, days are shorter, nights are longer, and you can very easily freeze.  After a long time, you can improve your base and make surviving ""easier"". It's a grand world of fear and surprises, I'm only scraping the surface.  ---Playing Singleplayer--- Playing singleplayer is great, but if you wanted to do that, Don't Starve is better for it. It's considerably easier, and it even has another gamemode, Don't Starve Shipwrecked that... Well, I'm getting off topic. Singleplayer is great, but it's not where Don't Starve Together is centered.  ><~~~Playing Multiplayer~~~><      Ooh, fancy.  Multiplayer is where Don't Starve Together both shines and falls flat. If you gather some friends and make a private server, it's a total blast! Some of the most fun I've had in a while. Spoiler alert, having food isn't as easy with 6 people. You can survive together, help each other, and if one of you dies, one can revive another for a relatively small price. Truly, in multiplayer, cooperation is key. And that's exactly why public multiplayer is the only real flaw in the game.  The game's community, if you haven't heard about it before, is... Well, it's something else. Over half of the people who play the game are imbecilic and lazy, or just game-ruining for a good laugh. If they don't play well or even decently, they're probably stealing your stuff, destroying your base, or literally just sitting around doing nothing!  True story if you care to listen, actually, I was once in a server that made it until late winter. We even defeated the deerclops, a major boss in Don't Starve. One of the players who lived in our base hadn't really accomplished much. The player that had helped our base grow the most was asking him politely to do something, and he didn't respond. I gave him a golden axe, and asked him to chop some trees for logs. He took it, and did nothing, instead asking for food. The other person started yelling at him to do something. Again, he did absolutely nothing. We ended up kicking him.  It gets MUCH worse than that, however. People just join, ask if they can join your base, or asking for key resources, with varying levels of grammatical errors. If you refuse, they'll give a quick ""f*** u ur a n00b"" and then proceed to either leave, or whine and complain until kicked, or until they inevitably die because they weren't actually playing the game.  ~~~Conclusion/TL;DR~~~ DST is an incredible game blending fun mechanics and stressful decisions. You definitely should buy it if you have friends willing to play with you. If not, then buying the singleplayer Don't Starve would be better... This game isn't worth it for public multiplayer. About 1 in every 6 servers you join will have a decent game waiting for you. Just about everything in the game itself is flawless... If you can take the community.  So, get ready for a fun night with friends. Deal with sanity, monsters, hounds, and especially other players. But most of all... Don't Get Caught Out In The Darkness Without A Torch. Can't wait for that game.",1467467260,True

76561198100680923,"Don't Starve Together is a great survival game, and one of the few games where survival is actually a challenge. This game has a high skill ceiling, and definitely takes time and practice. Playing with a friend will really make the game more fun as well. Now, here are the positives and negatives.  [b] Positives [/b]  -Tons of content -4 Seasons (all have their own content/challenges) -High skill ceiling (very hard and unforgiving) -Many characters with unique personalities and abilities -Skins for customization, plus Ancient King skins (which you need a friend to get them) -Many enemies and creatures, all with unique designs. -Incredible, Tim Burton atmosphere -Caves, which have loads of new stuff including the Ruins. -Sailing on boats, with islands to explore, colonize, etc. -Tons of different types of food to create (via crockpot) -Events such as the Forge and Gorge -Passionate devs who really care about the game.   [b] Negatives [/b]  -Absolutely no tutorial, this game relies on trial-and-error -After a full in-game year, there isn't much to do besides mega-base -DLC Characters. Very few, but definitely don't feel like they belong in this type of game. -Skins are pretty overpriced. On com. market, it's about $1 or less. However, the skins Klei offer are locked behind $3 to $5 prices which I think is overboard. Not much of an issue tho.   To conclude, this game is super fun, especially with friends. I do implore you to find an experienced friend to teach you, or practice a lot. It is hard at the start, and frustrating. You will struggle, that is a given. That is what the game is about, struggling. Keep playing, practicing, and you will only get better. Remember, the important thing to keep in mind is to have fun. Don't cherish your belongings/base, this isn't the type of game for that. You will make new worlds a lot, don't be discouraged. This is normal. Anyways, good luck, and Don't Starve!",1474752683,True

The game's community is very creative and there are hundreds of community-made mods for you to try out and change your experience!

Unlike most other games in this genre, it's not a resource grind--in fact, it requires you to spend your time efficiently and to think ahead to survive.  Survival actually always feels like a threat if you ever stop thinking.  In that sense, can be like a psychological war of attrition (which I love).  Also, I love the atmosphere and the characters: dark, yet whimsical; each demanding a change in your play style as you learn to work with their strengths and weaknesses.  Gets lots of developer love (somewhat to the exclusion of its single-player older brother), even including support for multiplayer using community-created mods and finding other players.

I like how many new things they are trying out with this game, like beefalo taming and riding, clothing to customize characters with, and just the fact that you can survive with others or perish in a land that has overcome you. I can't wait to see what is in the next update because you don't really know what could be done next. But I would say that this game is one of the funnest I've played because every time you load up a new map, it feels like a whole new game because of the randomized generation feature this game has in multiplayer and single player. Then having reign of giants come free with the game makes it even funner to survive, because instead of just summer and winter, there's spring, summer, autumn, and winter to survive through along with the other giants that come as the seasons do.",1453857106,True

76561198163112253,"This is simply the BEST survival game that you will EVER play, with friends or with people online. No other survival game really comes close to matching the aspect of ""surviving"" in DST.  The game is set in a beautiful, dark world where you choose a character with unique abilities to play with. You will begin the game with little to nothing, and you will have to figure out what you have to do to keep your character staying healthy and alive. Darkness, hunger, mobs, insanity, and the wrath that comes with each season of the year will kill you if you’re not careful.  As you learn more about how to survive in the game — through other players, by yourself, or through the helpful Don’t Starve wiki — you will survive more easily, and you will become better equipped to tackle tougher challenges, such as helping to kill big bosses such as Deerclops, or venturing deep down into the Caves to look for greater treasure. You will learn how to be as efficient as possible at base-building, food-making, item-crafting, and resource-collecting. Or, if you are not the efficient-type, you will enjoy wandering around the Don’t Starve world with a Garland on your head, Chester by your side, collecting Berries to eat, and picking flowers along the way. Or, if you just want in-game Skins, you can semi-afk to collect them, which you use to customize your character with, or trade away in the Steam Market for money.  Replayability is wonderful in this game. With every new playthrough, you will challenge yourself to do better than before, and you will encounter new survival techniques. However, you will always be susceptible to dying. Even with the numerous hours of experience that I and other players have, we will still die to unfortunate and/or unforeseen circumstances, and it will be hilarious.  All in all, a fantastic and beautiful multiplayer survival game made by Klei. The developers imbue this game with a lot of heart and love, and they continue to do so with the new events and updates. <3",1483378871,True

76561198111550830," There is Plenty to do in the game, especially when you play with friends. Enough content (and more being added) in the base game, and if you want more, you can change it up how much you want in the workshop by downloading mods for it.  I don't die much unless I'm killed by a random player, but when unlucky events do happen, or when you first start the game (Not used to the gameplay), I'd say this is one of those games with a slight Love/Hate relationship. You die over and over yet you can never hate the game. Not nearly as love/hate-ie as the first game though, Don't Starve, the Single Player Only game, as when you died there, heh, sucks for you!  The game sticks around Multiplayer gameplay, meaning all Boss HP is increased from the first game, as they're meant to have more people beating on them, I've Noticed that hunting rabbits (expecially with traps) makes it to where they don't respawn the next day or sometimes longer meaning that if there's alot of players eating the same food, you'll run out.  Basically, certain things may be more easy when you play alone, but yet when you play with others you'll get further, Because it IS a multiplayer game and that's what they stuck to.  The game isn't very glitchy at all. I have noticed a few here and there, but they're all ""Personal"" glitches as I call them, meaning: Only certain people get them and still have them even after disabling all mods and redownloading the game. (Example: I can't hear certain mobs, I sometimes crash out of the blue, ""Don't Starve Together Has Stopped Responding"")   I wouldn't say that's a problem on the game's part for now, but as some other people have ""Certain glitches"", Maybe not exactly mine, it may be.  Over all, this game is REALLY fun. It's a big step from the Single Player version, and (With the Beta) has pretty cute content c;   Though I would recommend more SMALLER mobs, as not everyone fights those raid bosses. Yes, Baby pets and No-eyed Deer have been added to NR Beta, but there's not alot you can do with those...and rabbits, for example, are getting a bit boring.",1483245137,True

Very helpful and interesting reading material to be found there.  There is a lot to do and learn how to do and even though you may get a bit frustrated with the game from time to time, likely you'll be dragged in to it again just so you can get that little bit better at surviving.

76561198089202086,"Don't starve together (DST) is very good survival game which doesn't need good PC to play. It may be boring for You if you don't have friends to play with, but community is nice so you should find some people to play with. It's like Don't starve (DS) with DLC Reign of giants (RG) but you can play with friends, there are costumes (You get them from presents while playing on server) which you can buy and sell on community market. I will show you cons and pros to buy this game:  +Nice survival game +Low PC requirements +It's DS but with friends  +Mods and costumes +Caves and free DLC (RG)  -Sometimes you can feel bugs -Without gamepad it's hard to play it -After some time it may be boring for some people.

76561198067174849,"This game is amazing!  but I do have so recommendations just to make the game more enjoyable to players who still really like to fight but when they die they don't want to start over.  The newest patch is great where you have the wild mode, but if you want a normal game, that you won't get angry at, you should add in the option to be able to add resurrection to the server you're currently playing in.  I often play alone since I only have one friend, trying to get more but you know I'm p lonely, and when i'm trying to set up my camp and enjoy the game and actually get to explore the entire map which I've never done it would probably be very beneficial to add that feature.

I reccomend this game, but be prepared to die a lot when you first start out and know that you can lose all of your progress at any moment... but that's half of the fun :')   Pros:  - Fun game, you can easily sink many hours into it.  - Very rewarding when you finally get it right and start to build a decent camp, gather supplies and the like.  - Great for playing with friends, or with strangers to create larger settlements and survive. - Lots to discover, I'm still finding new things as I explore.  - Unique, quirky art style.  - Cool monsters.  Cons: - The online multiplayer element of the game means that you cannot pause the game (you have to leave the game and come back, if you leave the keyboard you could lose everything before you get back) and you cannot save file in the traditional sense. This makes dying very frustrating, especially if you were doing well.  - Brutal game, everything wants to kill you and sometimes this gets too much.",1468272430,True

76561197963324072,"Very fun and addictive survival game where you can team up with your friends and try to survive in the wilderness against monsters, hunger, darkness and cold and keep yourself from losing your mind in the process.  Pros: + There is no perfect class. All classes have one or more weakspot aswell as one or more strength that counters another. All depends on your play-style what you want to go with. + I tend to have trouble creating servers and having my friends connect to those but on this game I have seen none of those problems. + Plenty of different game modes to fit to your preferred play-style. + The game rewards you with cosmetic items every once in a while to customise your character. + Countless hours of fun with your friends  Cons: - There seems to be no way of tracking your friends. When you reach a certain distance you lose track of their location. I ran around for ages joining my friend's server trying to find him and his camp until I eventually died in the dark. Add some way of partying up and maybe something that shows in which direction and how far away from you they are. - The game could use a tutorial. If you only just started playing your only help is checking the key-bindings. - Public servers are full of territorial hermits that will guard their camp at every cost and will not take friendly to intruders.

76561198112921462,"Did you guys notice the pun in the game's title? Don't Starve TO GET HER(Charlie) ;)  I've been playing Don't Starve since, about 2014 or 2015, I also recieved the beta version of this for free, and been playing since.  I gotta say, this game takes a really unique style to survival genres! I love the artstyle, the music is pleasant to listen to (besides ragtime, god is that hell to listen to for hours.), the characters are unique and in my view aren't broken in any way. Like you hear from others, it's MUCH more fun playing with friends! I honestly love how the continued the lore from the classic Don't Starve, and made it really interesting. I hope I can see more content in the lore from Klei, as it would be amazing! Anything else added like items would be amazing too.  And that people say that ""this game has no tutorial, therefore I do not reccomend"" or say ""Omg it's soooo hard to survive, such a lame game, it sucks!!11!1!!"" and honestly, don't even review the game if you can't figure out how to play or just look up guides.   Alright, time to get to the Pros and Cons.  Pros +Art Style is unique! +Music is great. +Love the customization in outfits! +It supports mods, to make it fresh. +Fun with friends. +Buying outfits are cheap. +No trolls (that burn bases), atleast for me. +So far, the expierence with support is superb!  Cons -Hard for someone that is new and doesn't know how to play. -The gift boxes for outfits rarely give any good outfits, they should make it so the more you open in a week, the more chances to get really good outfits. -Honestly, it does get a bit tedious after awhile if you can't make it to even summer. -You can't do much more if you can't add caves, which requires much more to run it. (Besides running in singleplayer or something)  (My Personal cons that don't count) =Not really that fun if you're a pro playing with a noob that you have to carry around like an extra bag of stones =Honestly, there are WAY too many people who join my servers and after I make base, they just stay there claiming to be ""taking care of the base"" when they just sit there cooking food in crockpots for no reason, and just eating it all. I know I can ban them and all, but it honestly feels so rude that I don't. =Hell, I haven't even gotten past summer myself! =There are also people who join servers that have a ton of days on, and don't do anything because they like being free fed and doing nothing for it. =Really hard to join servers that are hosted by strangers because I'm shy asf, so I just kinda hover around a bit. (STILL PLAY THE GAME THOUGH) =Barely anyone joins my server :( =Also, most fuckin' mods that are for DST are so cringe, like Undertale, anime, and furries, they get so much positivity for not atleast trying to make an original character (or just self inserting themselves).  Still, Great flippin' game overall, I LOVE it so much!!! Probably about a 9/10 for me.

Ton's of endless fun with friends, but the Workshop Errors get annoying I had a friend look through the error's and it is a Lua Script error and he cannot fix it however I do not think this is a problem with the game more a problem with the Developer of the Mod. But, a way too fix this issue is when you get the error and the Option either Leave the game or Disable Mods on top of it, it shows the list of mods enabled. Replace that with the mod(s) causing the error so the player/owner can delete it or contact the dev who made it too fix it. This is the only problem I find with the game but everything is great!

Keep in mind this game isn't finished. It's worth buying to support development, and even now it has plenty to make the purchase worthwhile. Controller support exists, but it's still in testing. You will have to hover your mouse over some menu options, like in settings or in the mod menu... but then you can use the Dpad to navigate. The settings menu requires you to hover your mouse over something that won't change value when you press A, in order to SAVE SETTINGS. Had to figure this out the hard way, no big deal... I'm sure they'll fix all these issues later... but even still, a controller feels great with this game, once you get used to the navigation issues. The in-game UI threw me off, but it makes a lot of sense once you feel it. I personally love it, the whole game. Atmosphere, music, controls, menu systems (that work), art style, and mod support!

I recommend this game as it is what it is, but don't be fooled by the cute graphics, it's harsh, your either freezing to death or overheating, if you survive that while getting resources some big ass giant will turn up each year to wipe what you build out, unless you proactively lure it away.  Finding out what you need to build and what you should keep makes it all so much worse, as not only is the above tedious trying to plan ahead with little knowledge of all the things ingame makes you want to throw your PC out the window!",1495979755,True

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

Story  - This game has no narrative, so...absent. Sound - Pretty good atmospheric sounds and ambience. Gameplay - There's a minimal sense of progression but all of it can be robbed of you pretty quickly. Without a leveling up system it leaves you feel like most games are a rush to get the best items and to hold out, like a surival game-lite moba. Replayability - Fair, but I'd still prefer Haven and Hearth over this. Positives:  +Attractive (if not a meme at this point) art style +Decent entry into the wave of survival-esque games +Cool sound effects +Doesn't require a gaming computer to run +Pick up and play +unlockable loot crate style items are more an ambiguous ""positive"" but it adds replayability Negatives: -Very weak combat system -Brutal winters unless you shorten them, thereby playing on a weaker difficulty setting -Griefers and player killers are abound on most non PVE servers -no strong sense of progression -no achievements  Final Verdict: I don't regret paying for it but I dont see myself playing DST very often with all the other survival type games out there that don't look like they were made in flash.",1500444017,True

76561198073600298,"Grass! Twigs! Berries! DEATH.  The name kinda tells you the base of the games objective but what you don't know is the depth of what you can and have to do to not starve. BUT NOW YOU CAN DO IT WITH FRIENDS!!  Find berries. death, carrots or kill animals for various types of meat that will fill your belly and even make you go insane! Depending on what food you eat, or how to prepare and cook it (by mixing it with other food and using a crock pot) it will restore more health, fill your hunger or increase/decrease your sanity bar. If you have the DLC (Reign of Giants) you will also have to deal with overheating and freezing to death (the freezing one is also in the base game)   Surviving is what your new life is about in this hellish new world. Find food, fight off monsters and hunger while always trying to keep yourself from going insane. Your food bar is always going down, forcing you to find food to fill your mighty belly. Health goes down when struck by enemies, eating rotten food or depending on your character (will talk about that below) damaged by certain specific events (like rain.) Watch your heat so you don't freeze to death, allowing your temp reach 0 or below will deal damage to you. But when its summer, watch out that the heat so welcomed in the winter will not give you heat stroke, causing the same effects and will cause unwanted damage to your player. Finally, your sanity. Sanity is drained passively while near thingys (objectives in survival mode) being in the darkness, at night in general, being near enemies or eating spoiled food or bad food. In the multiplayer version, you will also have to deal with people killing you and stealing your items. Make sure you focus on a good defense or offense to protect all you have worked for.  Many types of food to make, plenty of resources to scavenge for and potentially very massive maps that give you tons of content to explore for weapons, clothing, gadgets and trinkets.  Several unique characters make replaying when you die worthwhile, if you hate wilson and his scientific beard, play as the robot who hates rain, or as the strong man, who is a bulldozer on steroids when his hunger is filled but becomes weaker when it is not.  Track your progress and ""high scores"" by tallying your days (it will do this by itself and give you exp for new characters this way but more for bragging rights) and try and pass them every attempt.   You will die, trust me. The first couple tries will kill you and if by some luck or amazing skill you made it far enough to see your first winter, that will kill you.   Modded characters are fun to play, all set with their own pros and cons, and most being very balanced and playable in-game. + most of the mods are very helpful, like tracking your stats better, keeping your items better stacked and allowing for easier travel.

However, there are some points i did not like so much: First, the only way for us to get rid of lagging was a dedicated console server (this however works very well). Having to start a dedicated server is quite a piece of work, even though there is a docker image available.  Second, i really dislike games without a pause option. Its more or less impossible to leave your PC while running the game, this could have been handled better. Like using some kind of vote mechanism in multiplayer games.

76561198007547652,"Don't Starve Together is a nice, easy to play (but hard to master) fun survival permadeath game. I'd recommend it, except for one major problem.  With multiple people on the server, if you die you turn into a ghost. Somebody must use a Telltale Heart on you to revive you, or you will forever be a ghost and only be able to haunt people.  There's one major flaw with this; public servers. If you're in a public server just playing and don't have a friend to communicate with and give you a Telltale Heart, you are forever stuck as a ghost and can only haunt people until somebody decides to give you one. That is a TERRIBLE mechanic; it's a good idea except for the fact that you cannot respawn even if you want to. Maybe if you could respawn and just lose all your stuff versus being given a Telltale Heart and retaining it it would be okay, but the fact that if you, like me, were at 9 health running around in the night-time with a Blue Hound following you like a gay following his boyfriend endlessly until you are killed, and when it kills you you are eternally a ghost, makes it a terrible game.  Minus that fact, it's good.... but that is the most stupid thing ever. Don't Starve Together gives you the ability to host a dedicated server that is open for lots of players (who you don't necessarily know) but when you do that it punishes you by making it so if you die you must have another person to be able to revive you to be able to play the game, and if you don't, the world must be reset (for whatever reason) or you are forever Casper's twin.  P.S. this was a rage-induced review, so forgive me if I'm incorrect in any way.

Rubber-banding, getting hit by enemies from the opposite side of the screen, clicking something and failing to interact... you name the lag symptom, we've had it. We've tried everything to make it work: ""no lag"" mods, turning our computer settings to maximum power, not using cosmetic items, etc. Nothing works. Sometimes we can play for half an hour before the lag starts. Most of the time it starts within five minutes in the world. All of this even happens when we're on LAN.   Also, a small gripe: on the rare occasions we've gotten it to work, we discovered that thermal stones for winter now have durability in this version. Why? That's a horrible decision.

76561198250942048,"My rating is due to many often ignored cons about this game. For starters, the game is designed inherently to be played by casual gamers, however, the game is excessively punishing to casual players. You'll spend about 59 minutes out of every hour holding the A button and doing nothing else. The content of the game is tiny and isn't frequently updated enough to justify its current size and therefore, it has very small replay value. The game can be easily beaten in about 2 hours with most content unlocked. After you've beaten the game, the only way to continue playing it is to play it the same exact way you played it the other 3000 times you played it. The worst character in the game ""willow"" had a patch that nerfed her lighter, which wasn't even a good enough benefit to justify using her in the first place. Why nerf a character that's already virtually unplayable? Bad game design and decision making on a grand scale. There is a huge list I could pile onto the desk of other issues that face this game but most of that list would sound more like needless complaining rather than helpful information, so that's for you to speculate based on your own preferences and bias. However, the last thing I'll touch on is, the game is terrible with controller recognitions. If you use a PS controller, not only will the game treat it like Xbox, but in game, it will still instruct you to use a keyboard input rather than telling you which button on your controller to use. This can cause widespread confusion on new players and is often a complaint I see from them on different forums boards and other outlets. I'm done sacking on this game now. Enjoy.",1535250802,False

76561197966482898,"I bought this game for me and my long-distance girlfriend to play together.  And it was exactly what we needed.  Something that required intellectual skill, but not technical skill.  In other words, I was looking for a game that wouldn't be hard to play for a novice gamer like my GF.  Because this game uses a point and click interface, it was perfect.  Also like I said, this game requires teamwork and smart decisions to be successful.  You must communicate with your teammate and pay attention to many details.  There is very little room for rest in this game, and I find myself satisfied after only a single round.  Essentially the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.  To do this, some of the essential tasks will be finding or creating food, making clothing, resource gathering, staying warm, and fighting off monsters.  Items are crafted by gathering raw material and special items from the world such as grass, spider's silk, lumber, and minerals.  What's great about this game is its randomly generated terrain.  This essentially means you'll have to modify your strategy in every game.  Sometimes you'll be dropped in lush garden of eden.  Another time you may be dropped in a barren desert and have to travel a long ways to find a suitable campsite.  The ratios of fruits, raw material, and animals will also vary as well as their geographic location.  It's definitely a game of learning from mistakes and trail and error.  You'll learn to set goals to achieve in x number of days, avoid danger, memorize crafting recipes, prepare for sudden weather and monster attacks, and sustain yourself.  Be prepared to meet moments of indecision as there are many many items that can be crafted.  I recommend consulting the wiki as you learn more.  I'd recommend this to any one who likes co op games.

At first this game handled lootboxes considerably better than most other implementations of RNG based microtransactions as all rewards were earned ingame, with [u]absolutely no in game store[/u] deviously manipulating you to buy packs, and it really did feel rewarding to open boxes unlike pretty much every other game using them. But now that those days are over any enjoyment i might get out of opening a lootbox is overshadowed by the pessimistic dread that accompanies these predatory monetization systems. I'd be fine with spending a little to help support the game if i didn't have to gamble for what i want, and even if lootboxes are not legally gambling, it is just as predatory and unethical.

76561198050816685,"Don't starve together is certainly unforgiving. With no tutorial whatsoever, nor tooltips, the game seems to be built around exploration and tactics to survive. There are four seasons: Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer. Autumn is the default with no environmental hazards. You heard me.  Each season sans autumn has an environmental hazard. Winter has its cold, threatening to kill you of frostbite. Spring has rain, driving the non-british characters of don't starve together (bloody yanks) to nuts and bolts. You might think summer would be the safest season. It is far from THAT! You'd need a lot of nitre and at least two thermal stones just to survive, as well as clever manipulation of underground and above ground resources. You should never waste resources in this game. Every single one counts.  Let me tell you something about spring - which killed me more than once. Spring rains are very common, requiring you to make an umbrella by killing a pig or finding a source of pig skin through pig heads/pig houses. Now, when you do make an umbrella, expect to be struck by lightning frequently lest you make a lightning rod. Yet even a lightning rod cannot protect you from the horrors of the French, Hon hon hon, they laugh as they fall out of the sky, killing you by surrounding you, then punching your private parts with the sheer force of their disgusting tongue. Wretched and evil is the tongue of the French, that it smells of stinky cheese and escargot. They need not even aim it directly at you - the sheer smell is enough to damage you. Their pilots are dangerous, dropping them off when visibility is low and our fighters cannot engage their transports. The battle is hard fought with your own infantrymen punching, getting at the French, but they outnumber them, and eventually succumb to their disgust and die. You must retreat, in utter humiliation, and eventually stare down the face of death itself - frogs.",1468000366,True

76561197972040704,"My opinion will assuredly be a divisive one, but I find that the best survival games are games in which dealing with hunger, thirst, etc. are something that is a huge deal, but eventually wanes after you establish a good base of operations and a system, making the gathering of food, water, etc. a very minor task with other activities taking the forefront.   Empyrion Galactic Survival had me picking plants and killing space raptors and cooking the meat to stay alive while on the run, trying to heal myself and get some ore and supplies to build, and once I stayed alive long enough to build a little base, I could make a refrigerator and a little farm with growth lights over it and make my own food. After that, I had to always be wary of my hunger, but it was not the entire goal of the game any more. In Subnautica, getting fish to eat was and fish to produce water from was a big deal. Then you get a few upgrades, find the most filling fish, pack 'em with salt to make them last, find spots with heaps of water-generating fish and machine parts to extract clean water, and you're good to go! You always have to watch the meter and carry some goodies with you, but that is largely behind you now. Even Minecraft, which I didn't really like, allows you to heavily get some production going to handle hunger.  In Don't Starve Together, however, even with a team mate, food acquisition was our entire point of existence for far too long. She would wander off desperately looking for food, I would do the same, and we'd meet back up and eat what we had. It was never enough, despite devoting our entire in-game days to gathering food and just enough wood, etc. to make a fire to survive through the night. On a few other runs, we tried creating technology, but we could not find the components we needed to create stuff that would be of any use. On top of that, I simply did not like the tech options that were listed based on what I read of them.  To me, this game was a complete and utter chore to play. I am not exaggerating when I say that I would rather be at work than playing this game. I am happy that others are able to derive some joy from it, though I absolutely cannot.

The game keeps throwing challenges at you, or destroying your stuff to make it seem more than it is. I found the fact that this game has many rave reviews bothersome. I cannot find much to like about the game other than art and sound.      The game itself wouldn't be that bad, if it had some kind of story, or reason for you to do these things. What it gives you is a randomly generated world that has limited reasources, which forces you to move on continuously. Leaving behind all the items you have built. For some people this may be fun. As for me I found it as enjoyable as working in an assembly plant. With all the charm too.       I have interacted with the ""community"" for about a month or so and have found them lacking. I have had to edit my review multiple times to hopefully help to them understand why I don't like this game.       I even tried again to like this game after the ""community"" bashed on me for writing a negative review. I found myself gazing at the game in a mild hypnosis, grinding away getting resources. I was in a trance for about 2hrs, not because I liked the game, or because I was enjoying myself, but because I was just playing to play.       After that I took the time to re-edit my review and again the ""community"" pounced and started hating on me for not like their game. Well too bad, I can't find any more redeeming qualities to the game or its ""community."" I don't feel like being part of a ""communtiy"" that has to defend its like of a game by tearing those who don't like it down.

The Forge gamemode: It is a gamemode I've enjoyed a lot which is the closest thing this game has to a dungeon. Despite the fact that there is no innate competitiveness, there is a lot of rampant toxicity and elitism in The Forge gamemode. Every game I've played in that mode, there was someone harassing another player based on either their ""level"" or ""wrong actions"" in-game. Since there is no mute button or report feature, a lot of these issues fly under the radar and I expect this level of toxicity to remain constant despite the casualness of the game.   Base game: Even though it is a co-op game, a lot of the players harbour a constant fear of strangers leading them to be very hesitant in offering aid. Couple that with the fact that certain players expect others to be a veteran DS player creates a community that is not very helpful or welcoming towards newer players. Admittedly, griefers may appear and burn down your base or newer players may not know what to do and drain your resources. This paranoia permeates throughout the playerbase. Nevertheless, it is a game that requires a lot of personal research on your part despite its casual nature. There is no definite goal to the game, you are simply required to survive for as long as you can. Progression in the game as a whole is based on getting cosmetic items.",1543042571,False

Don't starve together can be played single player or co-op, The majority of my little hours are co-op and a small amount of time singleplayer.  The game has a cool old fashioned art style and danger around every corner, unlike the first Don't Starve, death is not permanent; but does have a negative effect on future play.   Finding resources is easy, but you need to obtain large quantities for your crafting, which is fairly likited but enough for it to still be enjoyable.  Combat is an option, but isn't viable most of the time. You can craft spears and some swords late game, and basic armour that can help soak up a few more hits; but thats about it. Combat will get you killed.  All the tools die very quickly, even the harder to make ones with gold and other difficult to obtain resources.   Cooking is awesome, but requires lots of different ingredients which are usually painful to obtain. Also, very little dishes replenish health, and if they do it's never very much.  Imo, if I was motivated to play I'd have a blast.

My friends had bugs like clicking a monster to attack it, instead they start walking towards it. Stuff like that put us off a lot. A couple of months later this game is a blast. We had so much fun without all these bugs. It was amazing to just play all afternoon, build a nice big base, have stored enough food and materials to survive the winter, just so a giant can come, destroy out base and kill us. Twice. On two worlds. Even then it was fun and enjoyable. I recommend this game to and survival game fan as this is one pretty hardcore survival and rogue-like game. If you have 2-3 friends to play with, I suggest playing with them instead of joining a random server, but it's up to you.

Also want to go over the lag, you can work for a couple hours gathering stuff to get read for pvp then once you enter any kind of combat start rubber banding, which means your character will appear to be moving then dissapear or walk back to the spot you started lagging out on. its a host problem for the deicated servers so if they could update those it would be alot more playable. imagine getting attacked and trying to run away, with everytime you get some distance between you and your enemy and you think you got away, your character appears right back next to the enemy and half your health is gone, repeat until your frusturated and dead. in conclusion the game needs way more content as its way to easy to reach a point where you built everything and your kinda just waiting to die and start over. the dedicated servers need to be completely redone and the lag on those servers needd to be worked on for lag issues.",1422209364,False

Each base game character has pros and cons that allow them to be balanced yet fun, the combinations of these characters abilities also adds variety to gameplay.  Pros: Fun to play with friends Random worlds add challenge The customisation of characters (Visual and Team Composition is fun) The settings allow even more customisation of the world Mods from the community section add a lot of replay value  Cons: With many players the food can be lacking in some biomes The game can seem too punishing with enemies (Walrus Range etc.) ",1562178490,True

The game demands that you adapt and not only with the survival of the days, there are a lot of monsters that you can fight, even there are boss fights (boss fights that i not reached cuz, with my friends, we're a disaster).

Next we have the friend that has a mild sexual relationship to our crock pots and often does not trek further out than 10 m before getting homesick, not gunna lie hes pretty useless, but he makes us a tonne of food a bit like a housewife. Then we have friend number 3, who has recently been diagnosed with mild accute uselessness syndrome  symptoms: standing aroun the camp the entire day moaning about having nothing to do being useless dying abmormerly  he has set the record of dying the fasted as possible and he is bassically the definition of a noob.

76561198067601558,"Been some time since I started playing this one, huh? Nevertheless The Don't Starve Together is STILL one of those survival games, that are Actually cool. Graphics are unique Klei style. It's like a comic book/video game crossover. Every monster, character and even object has unique feel to it, as well.  Gameplay isn't just ""another survival game"" thing. It may seem simple at first, maybe even repetitive. But I still enjoyed farming stuff and repeatedly punching spiders in the face with a homemade Ham Bat (yes, iconic DS's weapon of choice), just for fun. Also, one of the hardest things in this game is planning ""What do I do next?"" stuff and being time efficient. And, of course, dealing with your friends absorbing fridge's contents, faster than you fill it. I guess you can't even free yourself from your silly buddies when going into virtual world. But it's not like I didn't enjoy having an extra challange, heh.  Audio fits well, it gives different tone to each of the Seasons present in game, e.g. Winter feels rather sad, Spring is a bit jumpy (in it's own positive purport). Of course, there couldn't be a good ol' Boss Fight, without the good ol' Boss Theme. Indeed, this game provides you with some encouraging tunes for such occasions.  Story. Yes, this game has a rather impressive lore for a survival game. Most of it is present outside of the game, though. Still worth doing a lil' research. DST's plotline is separate from Don't Starve (Alone)'s.  ------TL;DR------ Pretty decent survival game with unique artstyle, music, nice lore and Meatballs. Takes some time to get good at it (and lots of deaths). And Together implies you'll be able to get some friends to play with OR you'll have to use all of your patience for public plays.

DAY 1:  my friend went out for some silk and my other friend got wood and i was left to mine and gather food. Long story short my friend getting silk got killed by spider queen (dont ask ok) and my other friend was being attacked by treeguard. My friend managed to kill some spiders with his axe so i got 2 glands but my friend was low on health from treeguard  and i didnt know who to save. I ended up saving the guy dead, and we helped my other friend with treeguard. Day 2: Ok so we werent that good at the game and we decided to go into a cave but i was left behind in case of emergency. My friends didnt have the tools to survive in the cave and died from a variety of different things (earthquake, bunnymen, tentacles, etc) and i was last one alive. wow. Day 7: OK i was doing good on my own until i realized my sanity was low from the ghosts. I died from my own insanity and gg no re.       A year after buying:   Day 26: Me and the same group of friends were doing really well and decided to plan how we were gonna defeatdeerclops. We had plenty of food and supplies and we were fine on warmth.  Day 30: We beat deerclops but one of our friends died. The other died from cold/spiders trying to save said friend.

76561198098442932,"A very enjoyable game for people new to Don't Starve Together or returning players from Don't Starve. Sacrificing some content/modding abilities from the single player version to have fun, multiplayer style. The more players working to not starve, go insane or die together, the better i'd say.  In my personal experience Autumn is a good starting point and is quite an enjoyable season because in this season the players must get busy in preperation for winter and giants to come.   Winter hits, at first there is a bit of struggle, we hunt, travel, then gameplay becomes quite boring until the Deerclops spawns. (mostly because my friends and I feel their isn't much else to do at that moment but to wait out Winter. But that may be just our ignorence.)  Spring, is a pretty annoying season. Food does not dry while raining, periods of rain are really long, and your insanity drops very fast. But thanks to heat and items such as umbrellas i feel spring is pretty balenced.  (Fighting the Moose boss was no walk in the park.....especially since we got Rekt'd by the little gooslings........)  Summer, ah summer, the season of rage quit and throwing your computer out the window.

76561198171033130,"The pinnacle of survival games, which actually requires players to survive. Normally survival games are just, start off with nothing in the wilderness, kill everything else and build a castle. This game requires players to actually work to stay alive and build a settlement to further aid in their survival creating a highly unique and innovative experience. Unlike many other games, it also uses a very stylized and intricate art style as well as having a very well written although unspoken plot.  The game features a healthy amount of randomization which makes each world relatively individual and fresh, and while the combat system is simple it manages to still feel satisfying. While including a lot of grinding like most survival games, in this one it barely feels like a chore because the player is constantly working to gather the supplies to immediately build something new. There are only a few instances where the reward for time spent is very far off, what the player chooses to do is rewarded or punished very quickly.  The game however makes no effort to teach the player anything, which results in both a more refreshing experience and an unfair one. Players will die numerous times to things they had no way of preparing for without looking up a guide, which potentially involves numerous world resets and lost progress. It does not feel as bad as normal trial-and-error psuedo difficult gameplay, but it still can be a problem. Especially when the game will continue to dish out unfair situations even after players are experienced; as there is always one more thing players did not know, which they are punished for not knowing.  Finally, the game also has problems with balance. As there are many overly effective tactics players can use to make survival much easier. The game puts so much effort into being punishing and unforgiving yet there are random aspects of the system which are far more lenient to the player for no reason. Which means if players enjoy difficulty the game hypocritically makes certain things far easier then they should be, just because. Various content in the game is also underpowered or overpowered in general, and so there are certain items players will default to using a lot and others they barely will. This even including the playable characters.  While the multiplayer side of the game is exceptionally enjoyable, when in a good team, the public multiplayer is still susceptible to griefing. Although after a couple years some counters to griefing were finally patched in. There are also various bosses in the game which have their health scaled to ridiculous amounts in anticipation for multiple players being present, and so playing the game alone or with a small group will make certain fights unfairly challenging without the use of a health scaling mod.

76561198032527136,"Not so much a review, more of a few suggestions I wanted to make...  1) When you first boot up the game you are met with a screen with, besides other things, a ""play"" button and a ""quit"" button. Obviously in this window, clicking the quit button quits the game.  And the play button takes you to the main menu.  Now, at this point after pressing the play button, you're met with a ""logging in"" screen with an optional ""offline mode"" button on it.  Couldn't that be an option within the main menu itself rather than being automatic? Because my next issue is to do with the main menu itself.  My biggest issue is that the main menu ALSO has a ""quit"" button that quits the game. Basically, I think either you remove the redundant opening screen or you make the quit button go back to it.  Like I said a few lines ago, the ""logging in"" thing should be optional, because if I'm to slow to click ""offline"" then I'd have to quit and reopen the game again which, in my opinion, is a little convoluted.  Also, I don't know if it's just my computer, but the resolution seems to be terrible for me (1366 x 768) Is it because the game is dealing with an unknown shape and it's being squished unnaturally?",1554121314,True

Days getting shorter, nights getting longer just waiting for the souls to get you. Earn character customizations while you're sitting near your science station crafting items to help you.

Ok so now really, this game is all about, well... Surviving of course with friends. You get spawned, then immedietally have to search for supplies because night is coming, and it's coming fast. Then you forget to look at the clock, and it's night... First restart. Then you find these pigs, and are excited because they help you survive. Until... The green pigs come, and destroy you. Then you get way further just for you to realise... WAIT IT'S WINTER?!?! Another restart. You're prepared for winter this time, then you survive for quite a bit longer. Then... The unexpected happens. You're house lights on fire because it's... Guess what? Summer! Then you have to restart building, or restart because you're in the flames of your burning house. I think this is a warning for all new players.. Simply watch out for the cycle. When it's winter try to be prepared with a coat before hand, when it's summer put fans near the wood at your house, and you. Then all frustration ends, and you're back to normal, and happy again...

76561198335473938,"First off, it'll say this review was posted in 2017. Well I've changed my mind at this point and time. Just... read if you want to find out the horrible truth.. This game. Oh boy. Don't Starve Together is an amazing game, with developers that care so much about the game that they don't patch bugs that have been in for 4 years and literally break the ga- heh, anyways, it's still a very enjoyable experience overall, but I had just experienced the most disturbing thing I'll possibly ever see. I absolutely cannot recommend this game just due to the chance that this might happen to anyone else.  Ok, so, there is a character in the game named Wigfrid who is a battle warrior and mostly has to hunt for food. So I was just hunting right, in the middle of a desert, just waiting for that delicious koalefant to soon be in my stomach. But, well, there is also a 5% chance something much more terrifying can spawn. And I was one unlucky warrior that night. The ""Varg"" (swedish for Wolf) is a massive Wolf that summons its other wolves to aid it in combat. It's truly an overwhelming enemy. Well, before I knew it, I was completely surrounded by hounds. But something was wrong.  The Varg deeply stared at me, and the hounds just kept barking. Usually after about 3 barks they attack. Well, all I had at the moment was like, some grass and twigs in my pocket and the Wigfrid character's battle spear and battle helmet. The hounds suddenly just darted in and carried everything I had away in their mouthes... keep in mind this whole time I was alone and in the middle of a desert. Well, within just a few more seconds, they tore off my skin ""Shadow Armor"". It's just a skin so not actual armor. Anyways, not much longer I was tackled by the mighty Varg itself. I knew I should have died at that moment. But life just kept going at me, huh?  You can probably imagine what happened right after that. So much was going on, I, I didn't know what to do. It was only about 30 seconds in that I had the entire scence scarred into my mind. Some time later my character just completely got knocked out, which I'm assuming was from deleriousness from the extreme pleasure. My character woke up the next morning with all the stuff I had next to me. Well, my hunger was full at least. I came back to the base very ashamed that day. Pretty much everyone laughed at me, some took screenshots. It was horrid, but nowhere near as horrid of what had happened yesterday. Sigh. Even Wigfrid was groggy, started looking like she was crying later.   Well, all in all, this game is what happens when developers make something good and decide to completely ruin it from just one thing. And yes, I know, you do not have to hunt in the game. But at one point in time, you'll go hungry and no one has food. It'll be your only chance really. And just the chance, that 5% chance of getting that image burned into your head. That's something scary.  If you do decide to get this game anyway, please. Just contradict the title. It's much better to embarrasingly starve than... I don't even want to remind myself of it anymore. Well, bye. Please, save yourselves from the Varg.",1491795212,False

I have played this series a long time, and Don't Starve Together was the iteration it always needed.  Don't Starve was BEGGING for multiplayer.  This game should be extremely fun with friends, to the point that I begged and wheedled everyone I knew to get it.  It's going to be amazing, I said.  I put a lot of my credit on the line with them; at my age, you don't have many friends, and about 10% of those still play video games.  I honestly wish I hadn't, because currently, Don't Starve Together is basically unplayable.  The rubberbanding gets worse and worse, the lag is atrocious.  Even on home network, playing with my girlfriend, it gets to be that you have to continuously restart the game until you don't feel like playing anymore.  We finally got everyone together online, my friend who more or less owns a supercomputer and 250mb down/50mb up connection hosted the game.  Within an hour, we were restarting the game every few minutes.     I am so goddamn embarrassed that I recommended this game to everyone, and we all got together for a night of playing, and couldn't enjoy ourselves, even with only 4 players.  If you read the reviews, this rubberbanding and lag issue has been going on since the release of the game, and the developers don't seem to be doing anything to resolve it.

Well since they offer a free copy of the game with the oringinal purchase of the game for 14.99 I gifted it to my friend and we've been playing it together ever since,this game is tremendous amounts of fun with a friend,probably even more fun if you have multiple friends to play it with!   So here's a lil story of our adventures together.  As I SabinSaberWolf and his trusty friend by his side we stared at this world bravely with no fear,but yet to know what the world actually had in stored for us. Our first adventure together we began trotting along the road and decide to make basecamp near a pond,we seen no frogs as it seemed to be deserted we ignored the fact there were two other ponds near by as we gathered supplies on day 3 we returned back to camp to live through the night by our warm fire as the morning soon came,least did we know we were attacked by a frog army,we ran and ran,but they wouldn't quit chasing us as we refused to give up our home! We decided to fight back,but soon did I notice my friend had fallen by the frog meanace! I refused to leave her there as I decided to fight the frogs to the death! I managed to kill one frog,but sadly the frog nation proved to be way more powerful than we could have ever imagined.  Our second adventure. Crazed out of our minds about what has just happened with the frogs we decided to play it more carefully and on our toes! Prepared for the frog nation as to whether it would attack again! We made a camp on the edge of the world where it was safe from the devilish frogs! As we remained safe and sound near rabbits.as a few days past we ate through all our supply of food and was forced to explore the world more in to the depths of the unknow,as we saw a few harmless bees we thought nothing of it,until we soon saw about 100 more nests as most of em' turned out to be evil bee nests,we quickly ran through the unknown to try and get away from the evil bees as they kept coming and coming as there were nests everywhere! There was no escape! They murdered my friend in cold blood as I knew I was outmatched with only my axe,as we only came there for some food as peaceful travelers! Least did I know I ran in to a dead end with no escape in sight as I stood there cornered by the evil bees with my axe in hand ready to fight to the death and for the honour of my friend! I swung and swung my axe with no mercy as I managed to murder two of the evil bees,but the rest still managed to over power me as I fell to the ground feeling my body getting cold from the multiple bee stings as the whole world soon turns to black as I awaken as a ghost and see my friend there staring at me as now we spend together forever as peaceful ghosts,but yet did we know,we were enterring in to a whole new world!  Adventure Three There isn't much danger in this adventure we managed to build up a camp with a hay wall built all around us with traps for bunnies n a farm growing our food together learning new things through our marvelous science machine,as we have not met anything to fear yet,we are living a pretty good life together surviving day by day,keeping each other sane as we possibly could. We're living the dream for now,everything is going so well for us now,is this really our happy ever after? Or is there something out there in the darkness stalking us? We try not to worry,but we have no idea what is haunting us,but we insure to be prepared for what ever life throws at us now! We musn't fail as this must be our time!  That's all of our adventures summed up to a point.  So in my opinion I give this game a perfect 10/10 one of the best games I have ever played in a long while that is co-op with a survival aspect. Also hopefully my lil stories didn't leave you a bore.",1439440801,True

76561198037516530,"Started playing this game with my roomate and both of us were disappointed.  Neither of us played the single player version.  There really wasn't anything ""fun"" about this game.  During the day, you feverishly scramble across the landscape grabbing all kinds of stuff that might be useful.  Night is fairly short, and you pretty much sit there by the fire, feverishly cooking food and getting as much crafting done as possible.  Then it's back to feverishly trying to find stuff around the world.  There really is no ""calm,"" at least for a relatively new player.  You're always slowly dying from starvation, too fast in my opinion.  A feverish pace is required for survival which, as a n00b, makes it difficult to explore the different, potentially cool stuff you could craft or explore.  Combat is terrible, and it's difficult to click on your enemy.  The game discourages fighting and experimentation by making death very punishing.  You have to find a special stone somewhere in the world or craft a relatively advanced meat effigy to resurrect one of you.  Nothing about the game is very rewarding.  Collecting stuff is rather mundane.  The traps are whatever.  Crafting something like an umbrella when it rains is just a way to die slower.  You don't build a cool house or anything like that - you're stuck with basic and advanced versions of an outdoor camp site.  BUT YOU MUST SURVIVE!!!!! ?? But why? What's the goal?  Survival? Okay, but that by itself isn't very fun.  Can I make a badass mansion or a cart track like in Minecraft?  No...  Do I get a well-designed, dynamic, and intense scavenging/trading experience like in This War of Mine? No........  Okay, do I get varied and interesting weapons, armor, and equipment like in Terraria?  No.....  Do I get a deep sense of human fear and connectedness, like in Day Z, when I'm not sure if someone will help me survive or literally kill me?  No.  Play another survival game.",1452579081,False

76561198183518214,"I was originally bagered by a friend to download this game so we could play together.  All I can say is, i'm glad I didn't spend my own money on this game.  To sum it up, you run around as different selectable cartoon characters- each with their own strength in ""something"" and each with their own particular weakness.  EX: Willow gains sanity points from fire, however if she becomes insane begins to freeze to death.  EX 2: Wendy has a ghost sidekick (her sister) who can fight for/with her. She can aggro and tank enemies, and deal damage. However Wendy herself has some of the lowest base attack damage in the game and has a hard time killing without her ghost.  The goal is simple: To survive. You must run around and gather food, collect materials, and build items to help you survive through each season or die. (EX: you need to gather items and craft warm clothing for the winter season or risk freezing to death). You also have to fight with the strange creatures that inhabit the land, some friendly but many of which will try to kill you for no reason. There are also boss fights at set intervals in the game, usually one for each season.  HOWEVER.  Why am I not giving this game a positive review?  Honestly this game loses its novelty very quickly. Once you survive through all the seasons at least once, you have gathered basically everything you need to survive those four seasons again. (The seasons loop).   The only real task you will have is basically gathering from then on, as you've probably explored 99% of the map by the end of the  four seasons. You'll run around just restocking on food, if you haven't already created your base camp next to the beefalo (some of the best source of meat in the game) and relocated all the tree's, saplings, and berry bushes you need right around your camp. Although you will have to leave to gather ores, as rocks are the only thing unrelocatable for convinence.  The only real replay value in this game is if you decide you want to try to survive with a different character, which will require some slight tweaking on how you approach surviving but not by extremely too much unless your the mime guy who basically dies to everything.   So sure, feel free to survive until day 100.....day 200.....day 300. It's just gonna be a repeat of all the crap you spent doing the first runthrough of the 4 seasons. Nothing new really occurs.  The Caves BETA is a very nice addition to the game, Kudo's to the developers on it. It does add another intresting layer of depth to the game. Instead of trying to survive on the base map you can try to survive underground in the caves, which poses a whole new set of challenges, and different creatures/plants/objects inhabit the caves below. That being said once you conquer the caves your back to the original rinse and reuse and repeat problem as stated above.  FINAL VERDICT:  First 3-4 playthroughs: 7.5/10  Replayability: 3/10  S/N: Im serious guys, It got to a point where me and my friend  legit had nothing else to do and conquer in the game that I started arranging berry bushes and tree's for fun for about 2 hours.

76561197967130716,"[h1]Don't Starve Together: 2 hours in review[/h1]  [b]Summary[/b]: A quirky open-world survival game that will trick you into a false sense of security with its Burton-esque art and goofy mannerisms and then punish you greatly by the end of night one.  In a sea of hyper-realistic survival sims, DST is a welcome breath of fresh air. Set in a strange little world that looks as if it was ripped from Tim Burton's mind, the game has little in the way of background. In the Single Player (Don't Starve) you wake to a man telling you that you had better find food before nightfall. No context, no other back story, just get out there and survive. In DST, you and your friends emerge out of a portal and set out to explore and survive. Lots of little laughs can be had at your character's comments and observations as well as the silly little things going on in the world.  DST doesn't seem brutal at first. There are cute little sprites for characters in the pseudo 3D world that bound about. Frogs, bees, rabbits, and a number of other creatures move around the world with you. Flowers grow and bloom, trees stand tall, and berry's hang from bushes inviting you to eat them. There are  few goofy moments as you run about collecting things, crafting thing, but this is a bit of a facade and perhaps your first enemy in the game. This game is surprisingly tough. It reminds me of Minecraft and DayZmod before there were guides up on the net. You get out, you run around, and maybe you attack something in hopes of food...then you die. You get out, you run around, and then it gets dark.....then you die. You get out, you run around, you survive the night and then you starve to death, or you run into some of the mechanical pig things that charge you, or you catch fire. As cute as it seems, it can be unforgiving. And when you die, you've got to have a buddy craft a heart to bring you back or you're stuck haunting around as a ghost.  Don't worry, though, its that challenging that's fun enough to keep you wanting more of it.  [b]The Good[/b]: The Atmosphere of the game is great. I love the Gothic, Burton-looking art style, and everything fits together very well. The game-play seems pretty balanced, and the crafting is handled quite easily; you don't have to put together complex patterns or obscure combos, everything is listed and what-not, which is good because you'll be a little more focused on surviving.  [b]The Bad[/b]: Its not for the easily frustrated. You'll probably have a good number of deaths in the first go of it. Some times the worlds spawn things you need early on in very rare quantities, and that can lead to you running around with nothing progressing for a while. You can fix this by customizing the set up for the server if you want.  [b]The Ugly[/b]: Finding spiders so you can craft the resurrection item sucks.

Don't starve with food would means that the people are just refusing to eat causing starvation which will lead to the stomach eating itself. Don't starve without food means that the people  either can not find food or have to fight for it and end up losing  the food which will also lead to the stomach eating itself.

76561198050345005,"The explanation of the Frontier Pack is pretty misleading, not very clear, and thus kind of useless. I already owned Don't Starve so I was just going to wait until it was free (if I understand what they are saying, although noone really seems to know). Then I saw the Frontier Pack that said you would buy Don't Starve and 2 copies of Don't Starve Together. For whatever reason, they decided that you can't take that particular copy of Don't Starve as a gift, so I just wasted money by buying the game I already have a second time, and STILL had to buy a THIRD copy to give to my friend. I think that's a bit excessive and pretty cheap. Maybe I just don't understand exactly how this works though? I didn't think it was unreasonable to think that I could use the 2nd copy of a game I already owned as a gift for a friend...  I know these reviews are supposed to be for gameplay, but right off the bat, that's a pretty frustrating issue. I shouldn't be confused about what I'm buying when I buy something. I read through the description more than once and also read the note they had for downloading it. Because of their poor advertisement and enclear writing, I've marked that I do NOT reccommend. HOWEVER, having played Don't Starve, I'm sure the gameplay is fine. If you do not own Don't Starve at all, this will probably be a very fun experience. My negative thoughts are solely based on how they handled people who already own the game. For everyone else, I do recommend this game.

The actual reason is that they don't port Shipwrecked to DST, lore-wise, Shipwrecked is a mere dream, so implementing it would be lore-friendly. Also, we need the option to play DST without hosting a server, in DS, having caves enabled didn't lag the player at all, but in DST, having caves enabled makes a significant lag.

76561198135614621,"""Overwhelmingly Positive"" There are several good reasons for why everyone rates this game well. While with the newer updates, it's getting harder for me to play (shitty computer), this game is still wonderful. Granted, in the beginning, a tutorial would've been lovely, and coming from me this means something considering how much I love exploring a game without the tutorial. If you're going to play, I recommend watching some Let's Plays or Tutorials. Now, onto the actual review;  This game is amazing, a lovely mix between 2D models in a 3D world, several bosses to keep you on your toes, and so, so many ways to die. Combined with several mods you can play, this game is hard to fall out of love with. Whether it being new bosses, new characters, or Klei's well made events, it's great fun to play. Want to become an almighty Spider Overlord? Well, become Webber! Want to demolish an entire ecosystem of trees and eventually get demolished by Treeguards, well... that can be any character... but hey, choose Woodie or Maxwell! Several characters for several play-styles, along with many bosses like the Spider Queen, Treeguards, Deerclops, Moose (accompanied with the deadly, yet cutely weird Moslings), even... a tiny Mushroom Tree... Huh... I feel like chopping it...  Anyway, away from the bosses, there are so many ways you can control this game. Believe it or not, starving is the least of your problems. Want to take up herding? We got Koalephants and Beefalo for you. Massive farming? Probably want to choose Wickerbottom for this, but from Berries to Dragonfruit, choose whatever you feel like growing. Just remember the several recipes if you don't want to get Smart Pot (mod). There are several things from Spider farming, Pig farming, Bee farming, plant harvesting, as well as fishing just to keep saturated. Each boss has their unique trait, along with many different ways to kite them. Pretty hard to kill a few of them with just some melee weapons. If you feel like it, you can even do Butterfly harvesting, cause Klei made a use for Butterflies! Just make sure you don't get too greedy. Unless you like weird demon Santa Clauses. With several mechanics, beautifully made worlds, and just the sheer difficulty of surviving a few hundred days, filled with hours of fun, this game is a heavy recommend from me.",1572430872,True

My friend was unable to find my world, and it took forever for me to find her game after she gave up. It was an infinite loading screen for her. Once we actually tried to get in the game DST just completely stopped responding and my computer froze for a few minutes before it crashed. Neither of our computers have run DST like this before, neither does it struggle so much with any other games. What happened? It used to be laggy, but it was still playable. Lately though it is impossible. Can't recommend a game that doesn't work.

Playing with friends, on the other hand, makes things a lot more interesting.  Being the douchebag that I am, it is always fun to verbally abuse and mess with people.  At the moment, I play this game with a friend and some random kid that we have made into our slave, aka b*tch.  He does most of the work, such as gathering and crafting.  He also plays a robot, which are designed to be the slave to man.  Therefore, it is the perfect role for him.  As a man, I do the hunting.  I bring home the bacon, in this case, rabbits.  We also have a woman.  She is pretty useless.  All she does is pms and burn down all the berry bushes the robot worked so hard to tend and grow.  She tells me she didn't do it on purpose, but who can believe the words of a woman?  I know I can't.  I always make sure I am well fed and well rested.  The safety and wellness of the others matter very little to me.  With a full belly and rested body,  I do not have to fear anything.    I usually start my day with breakfast.  Its usually meatballs.  Who doesn't like meat and balls?  After a hearty unbalanced breakfast, I make my rounds, putting rabbits in chests.  They survive indefinitely with no food or water, until I murder them.  I collect seeds, poop, and materials along the way, but I never venture far.  I have my robot slave for the hard labor.  The woman also like venturing off.  At the end of the day, I come back and eat more meat.  Sometimes, I am nice enough to cook more for the servants.  Sometimes, I don't.  I enjoy it when they rush back as fast as they can, hoping there will be food there, while they are on the verge of death from starvation.  It makes things more interesting.

If you join 5 minutes late, good luck chopping a tree down in the first week.  Make a bird cage, someone picks the bird out of it, and eats it before dying, then they drain your sanity as a ghost.  Almost dead?  Make some food, wait for it to finish then die in front of the crock pot as someone else takes it.  Need rocks?  Too bad, someone already made a giant wall around the base.  Added bonus: You can't chase away the hands when you get low on sanity.  Current playstyle: Hoard grass, hoard flint, hoard gold, hoard everything, then die, leave, or just sit on it while others have nothing.  Make a beefalo pen?  someone will kill it, eat the meat.  Oh, and don't forget the frog rain.  Say you have 5 people in the game.  One noob decides to attack a frog, and they swarm, kill them, then another player, then another.

Traditionally survival games have you build up to a point, but after two evenings of playing with 5 people we have no shelter, no armor, no weapons, nothing. We barely are able to build a science machine before some hostile creature comes and ruins everything. Trying to collect resources is like pulling teeth. You step 100 feet away from your spawn and you get chased down by a pack of 6 hounds, each with 150 health, while you get a measly amount of health and are lucky to do 20 damage on a hit, meanwhile the hounds can kill you in 1-3 hits. And each time you die your max health gets lowered until you can get one hit by a bumblebee. Progression is basically impossible as enemies are vastly more powerful than the player, and theres no progression of difficulty.

76561198032387023,"Tedious game with a beautiful make-up. Don’t Starve is one of the more popular indie games of the recent years for reasons I simply do not understand. It does look charming indeed. In fact, it has beautiful Tim Burtonesque style graphics and the game easily grabs the attention of anyone who takes a look at the screenshots. You start as a character whose only goal is to survive as long as possible. Similar to other survival games, you farm, craft, build to stay alive. The first problem with Don’t Starve is that the grinding part is simply boring. Often, it feels like a flash game with a fairly bad user interface where you click, click, click with your left mouse button without having any kind of fun. If you are curious about how grinding can be fun, please check Terraria out.   Second major problem with Don’t Starve is the permadeath. I am not suggesting that permadeath is bad per se, it can be quite enjoyable when it is done right. In Don’t Starve, however, it turns the tedious game design into something unbearable. You may find yourself grinding for hours, just to die by a random encounter (and it won’t be your fault). Oh yeah, some might suggest “that’s what the game is about” or “you will learn from your death”. Just give me a break… By now you should have played plenty of difficult video games to differentiate good game design from bad ones. Just look at the Souls series. When you die, you know you made a mistake. Maybe you made your move too early. Maybe you did not block the attack when you were supposed to. And if you die, you may lose your “souls” and thereby some of your progress, but not the entire game. In Don’t Starve, unless you are playing with a second monitor with wiki open, there is no way of knowing what will kill you. The only way to learn about what kills you is to be killed by it. And then you will start over, go through the tedious grind for hours and die again for another reason you could simply not prevent. In Don’t Starve, you are Sisyphus…   Last but not the least, the combat is atrocious. Combat in Don’t Starve is literally the same combat in any of the other thousands of flash games. If you have a good armor, left click the enemy until it dies. Or alternatively, make the enemy chase you and do your attacks while you are on the run.   If dull, repetitive games with poorly executed game mechanics are for you, play Don’t Starve. If you have a friend who happens to have the same tastes as you do, play Don’t Starve Together. But if it is the art style that pulls you in, your valuable time would be much better spent rewatching The Nightmare Before Christmas.  [b]3.5/10[/b]",1557790083,False

76561197965929511,"I like Don't Starve. I'm not sure how playing with online randos was supposed to enhance the experience, tho. In Don't Starve Together I spent 75% of the time dead, not knowing about the differences--or more often, because everything around the entrance was picked except seeds & flowers.  ""Git gud"" isn't helpful once you are already dead on the two ""Newbie Friendly"" servers with anyone playing. I will try private with friends sometime, but I see no reason to play with randoms. Community was as helpful and friendly as in LoL. I see DS as a roguelike, or like an old NES game: learn from your deaths. But for DST the best way to learn is to research? No thanks. I buy games for fun and discovery, not so I can rote memorize what others figured out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not faulting the difficulty. Difficult is great when one can insert another quarter and start over. But, if you die in DST you just sit there, not playing the game until others find time for you. People you've just met who are already annoyed that they are getting brain drained have to come rescue you.  My final complaint is that the loading screens are too way too long. Even just the list of servers takes over two minutes to come up. In DS loading took a bit (meaning I know this laptop is an underperformer), but nothing like in DST.   If I could go back I would have bought Oxygen Not Included on sale instead of the DS bundle. O2NI is in early access and it's massively fun!

76561198069781492,"Having played only ten minutes of Ricochet I can assure, without a microgram of uncertainty, to anyone of any background, that the interactive experience known as ""Ricochet"" is the cornerstone of Human achievement in the arts--nay--the peak of man's consummation itself! I see myself to be perpetually indebted to whatever deity unfurled the momentary lapse and position in which not only is this masterwork accessible, but also that I dwell in the juncture of living among the virtuosos who gave birth to the interactive marvel. How might a single mind solicit to inspect such a transcendent monument? Be forewarned, dear reader, that I, nor any man, could possibly hope to dissect a work of this calibur by his lonesome. Hell, I refuse to consider that an array of one thousand strong could decipher it! However, similar the prodigies that created it, I can only hope to muster the copious amounts of genius pouring from this work and cram it into the confines of the english language.  Upon initiating ""Ricochet"", you are greeted with so much symbolism to consume that most average citizens of our realm would choose to exit such a dense and meaningful screen. It is too much to the man with an anemic consciousness. I hardly know where to start when considering bringing this knowledge to the common people. I shall begin with how the work addresses the aboriginal of life and nature itself--birth. The anterior screen showcases many images, one of which tends to dominate the human's attention, as it is the most leviathan icon currently viewable. The gargantuan circle adorned by futuristic glows and structures is a symbol for the birth of the individual, as well as the birth of man into the technological age. Allow me to elaborate. The neo-digital ring depicted is an obvious allusion to the birth canal that nature devised each human to pass through. ""Ricochet"" proves this by how close up to the circular (or rather, somewhat polygonal) shape the art goer is. The moment is almost demonstrated as if your head is about to pass through, yet you are not quite out yet. You, dear reader, may be asking ""Well, if it were the birth canal depicted, why isn't there a light on the other end? Isn't that usually how the birthing process is shown?"" Well dear reader, you are absolutely right! Keen observation of yours, if I do say so myself! However, this is clearly intentional coinciding the entirety of ""Ricochet""'s premise. You see, ""Ricochet"" proposes that in a rapidly advancing digital age, you are born into as much shadow as you were conceived in originally, hence the futuristic design of the configuration. Whether or not the craftsmen of this piece intended to imply that we are merely headed in that direction or we have already lived this concept is entirely disputable. There is much, much more to discuss about this object, but for now the picture requires more context, so I shall leave it at that. Moving on to the next point of interest, another image stands out. Yes, the icon associated with the game's title (to be discussed later)--the feature's logo. On first observation, one may assume the logo is but a relapse of something straight out of a 1980's film--font and all. Be that as it may, the visual holds a profound connotation. When the logo is rotated 180 degrees, the image appears to imitate the lower section of a triangle! Of course! Now, as you would assume from such a work, this holds a variety of nuance. However, I will discuss my interpretation of the logo's meaning. You see, the bottom of a triangle can be associated with the masses. The largest in number, yet trampled upon by its aristocratic counterparts. A classic case of the proletariats versus the bourgeoisie. The logo attaches itself with the work--""Ricochet"". Clearly, the masterpiece's author's intended to represent the common man. Not only that, but the logo suggests something more, as it is rotated so the bottom of the triangle is at the top, The rotation confronts the idea that this piece will give the proletariats the power to overthrow the few that control them and restore power back to mankind itself. While this has not happened, I presume that the craftsmen who administered ""Ricochet"" assumed that would happen. That is one of the major reasons for the game's futuristic settings, after all. ""Ricochet"" shall not bring light to the people until technology and the people have collided with one another, allowing the work's true power to disseminate. Such tenacity bequeaths my soul optimism for our posterity. What beauty to behold, the day ""Ricochet"" provides its rightful nectar to the dry third eyes of the public! Excuse me, I got a tad passionate there. Yet, the principal still stands. I digress, there is more to discuss, and so little allotment for one lifetime! The next immensely abstract element of ""Ricochet""'s title card are its four options. Of course, an important element to any interactive piece: choice. ""Ricochet"" insinuates that any choice you make can be boiled down into four simple decisions: ""Find, Create, Options, and Quit"". Allow me to elaborate on each of those phrases. Find--discovery, you choose to make a journey of some kind to quench your nature-given curiosity. You may not only find what is on the outside, but also evaluate what is on the inside. Create--to craft, to make something of your own. To use your abilities to craft your own solution to any problem. To create is to show yourself to others, much like the artists of ""Ricochet"". Options--to alter or change how you will solve a problem. You may not solve the solution in the most efficient way, but by changing how you operate, you can avoid any negative feedback one may receive. And finally, quit--to cease, to make null any progress of your heart and mind. To stop evil, or to stifle good. The most threatening and harsh choice of them all. Each of these choices can be intertwined with one another, yet they each build a unique experience. Moving along with my simple observations, the first two options specifically state the word ""Server"", along with ""Find"" and ""Create"". It's my humble opinion that the word ""Server"" serves as an opportunity for the creators to manifest a dissection of religions and their deities and how they are found by many people, and how each and every one of them was also created by many people. A ""server"" is someone who, well, serves another man. Many look to gods as mere reflections of mankind, showing them as forgiving or blessing, rather than a lonesome creator of all. The authors of ""Ricochet"" point out the obvious irony that humankind tends to worship themselves when establishing religions based around gods. These deities, while on a surface level they are higher than humans, are merely there to serve as a torch to show man its way. ""Ricochet"" shows these two options alongside one another to demonstrate how comedic and silly the concept of religion seems to be. While you may not personally agree with those statements (and I may not as well), it is the view of mankind that the work builds. True or not, the work still stands. While there are many more avenues of the starting screen, one man cannot possibly see them all. I, for one, cannot hope to understand every concept displayed. Therefore, I must continue my analysis.  Without getting into the still immensely compact consequences for selecting one of the phrases, the systems of ""Ricochet"" hold a host of implications. First off, you, the player, control a clearly hominoid individual. You represent a member of the public. A representation of the base of the triangle of class, as discussed earlier. In this future, you are pitted against another bipedal combatant, to serve as entertainment for the bourgeoisie. There is no other explanation of the ridiculous colours you are adorned with. It's an allegory for a sport, two opposite teams compete against each other to entertain--  Wait, I'm running out of space! I'm afraid that's all I can say... don't be fooled, I-",1514826512,True

76561198013135239,I started playing this and got addicted without ever playing the singleplayer version. It was a blast. Then you learn everything and its just easy to play. The hardest part of this was other players and also the easiest part not actually the game itself. You want to get far in this game you need to learn from others since this game doesn't explain shit. Everyones fights over resources to get first and fights over bosses to fight. Because its not very challenging and usually 1 person can boss alone. Taking DS and not compinsating for other players by adding more resources/biggermaps/strongerbosses kinda just makes 1-2 people have fun while the rest get to be bored. Most people end up throwing in mods to keep themselves from dying of boredom and the only official servers are full 90% of the time. So playing without mods/or weird level settings you need to usually start your own server. That being said if you've never played DS before your going to have a blast. You want more of a challenge play DS. I would recommend DS over DST for singleplayer but i can't recommend DST for multiplayer for a DS experience. The only thing i can recommend it for is lootboxs and skins grinding away for those can really waste your time if your bored.,1517350030,False

76561198146091547,"Love the original game but the Forge is another beast entirely. It takes quite a while just to find a group to get started for some reason, many people are bouncing from lobby to lobby and the quickmatch system elimatinates the chance of looking for specific players/levels. It also appears to have a much more toxic and low effort community than what you typically find in DST since the Forge is a much more forgiving/shorter game mode.   On the subject of low effort, the encounter itself isn't particularly difficult but most groups don't even get close. It looks like most players have never played a multiplayer dungeon game before and don't care to understand or execute simple concepts/strats and would rather just mash the attack button and cry for heals.  I assume the idea was to warm up more of the casual playerbase to approach more difficult, fun and well-scripted boss content in the regular DST game. Unfortunately the execution appears to be just plain terrible in the way that lobbies are set up and players are distributed ie. the quick-match system. The weapon and armor skill kits also leave something to be desired.  These issues really need to be addressed asap since the way the Forge UI is now integrated with DST seems like there's something rotten in an otherwise beautiful product. Also I believe the artwork is beautiful and should be monetized but the skin UI and lootbox system is awful to use and just looks below KLei.

Conclusion: Klei leaves it to the players to create a player friendly environment where you can interact in a sufficient way (discord, teamspeak) and find friends (Klei forums, steam groups etc.).

76561198044801998,"TL:DR This game will kill you endlessly for your ignorance without ever explaining what went wrong or why. Don't play it.  Absolutely do not play this game, UNLESS you have played the normal Don't Starve. Why? Because this game expects you to be a master of the original (because adding this feature to the original game was just too hard and making money off people is great).  I'm known for enjoying a challenging game with friends. But this game is not a challenge, it's just a constant death sentence. Even after having learned as much as I could from wiki's and friends who love Don't Starve, I always found myself dying. It just isn't fun to die because you're ignorant of something that you can't possibly learn without cheating or using a wiki. Not saying I need my hand held, but just being told that this item is going to vanish from the face of the earth in the next few minutes would have been nice to know.  Those of you that enjoyed the original game, play this with random people on public servers or play with other friends that have beaten Don't Starve. Do -not- try to get friends that have never played the normal version to play this unless you plan to force feed them information for 12 solid hours. (That might not even be enough).   Pros It's popular enough to find plenty of random public servers. It's a lot like the original game (so I've been told). It seems simple. The game has an easy interface.  Cons Every character is either brokenly good or dies incredibly easy. (Yes, I did say everyone.) Rogue-like deaths with no rewards. (You die, game over, that's it.) (CORRECTION: You get vanity clothes... Woohoo?) No tutorial, guide, or in game help of any kind. (Get ready to read a lot of wiki's) Difficulty increases dramatically over time, making joining a server a day or more old completely pointless. (Instant death if joining in the summer or winter.) Perma deaths on servers. (Many public servers are forgotten because people spawn in a die on the spot.) (CORRECTION: You can roll back time one day, according to @Egg. Never seen this used though.) Even after tens of hours of gameplay, expect to keep dying after only a few hours in a new world. (Why are you still reading this? Just walk away from this game already)",1500434306,False

76561198348495130,"First off, it'll say this review was posted in 2017. Well I've changed my mind at this point and time. Just... read if you want to find out the horrible truth.. This game. Oh boy. Don't Starve Together is an amazing game, with developers that care so much about the game that they don't patch bugs that have been in for 4 years and literally break the ga- heh, anyways, it's still a very enjoyable experience overall, but I had just experienced the most disturbing thing I'll possibly ever see. I absolutely cannot recommend this game just due to the chance that this might happen to anyone else.  Ok, so, there is a character in the game named Wigfrid who is a battle warrior and mostly has to hunt for food. So I was just hunting right, in the middle of a desert, just waiting for that delicious koalefant to soon be in my stomach. But, well, there is also a 5% chance something much more terrifying can spawn. And I was one unlucky warrior that night. The ""Varg"" (swedish for Wolf) is a massive Wolf that summons its other wolves to aid it in combat. It's truly an overwhelming enemy. Well, before I knew it, I was completely surrounded by hounds. But something was wrong.  The Varg deeply stared at me, and the hounds just kept barking. Usually after about 3 barks they attack. Well, all I had at the moment was like, some grass and twigs in my pocket and the Wigfrid character's battle spear and battle helmet. The hounds suddenly just darted in and carried everything I had away in their mouthes... keep in mind this whole time I was alone and in the middle of a desert. Well, within just a few more seconds, they tore off my skin ""Shadow Armor"". It's just a skin so not actual armor. Anyways, not much longer I was tackled by the mighty Varg itself. I knew I should have died at that moment. But life just kept going at me, huh?  You can probably imagine what happened right after that. So much was going on, I, I didn't know what to do. It was only about 30 seconds in that I had the entire scence scarred into my mind. Some time later my character just completely got knocked out, which I'm assuming was from deleriousness from the extreme pleasure. My character woke up the next morning with all the stuff I had next to me. Well, my hunger was full at least. I came back to the base very ashamed that day. Pretty much everyone laughed at me, some took screenshots. It was horrid, but nowhere near as horrid of what had happened yesterday. Sigh. Even Wigfrid was groggy, started looking like she was crying later.   Well, all in all, this game is what happens when developers make something good and decide to completely ruin it from just one thing. And yes, I know, you do not have to hunt in the game. But at one point in time, you'll go hungry and no one has food. It'll be your only chance really. And just the chance, that 5% chance of getting that image burned into your head.

There is no skill involved in it. If it at least was a bit like Zelda A link to past it could have been far more fun. Build an iron armor or wood armor as quickly as possible btw. But the best way to combat spiders is just by using traps.  Various things are a bit unreasonable. Like food. Why do I need to eat 8-7 steaks to fill up my hunger to max? Do you really eat 7-8 steaks per day? You can eat so many roasted berries without getting full either. It's kinda ridiculous.  Why does the temperature gets to freezing during rain in spring when the normal temperature was 27 celcius? Also why can't I just build a shelter to stay under? Also why does it rain for what seems like 3-4 full days?  Why do I need to use poop for every plant I plant?    Overall it really isn't all that fun.

One in particular is the 2d powerhouse Terraria. I really wanted to enjoy Don't Starve. I had seen the Totalbiscuit review of this game ((that part where he hunts for manure LOL!!)), and thought the game had looked interesting at the time. However, I had clearly not had paid too decent attention to the review.. when we fired the game up, my laptop, his pc, we began chosing characters. To which poses the question.. Why are there no african american characters? Is it coicidental that the actual only ""dark"" character happens to be a monster, aka, the spider? It's 2017 now, and in this climate of change, you would think that the indie game scene would be the first to change. I've seen some games take charge in the war against racism and white privelege, but this is a survival game, which strives for REALISM. In an apocalyptic setting, there would be african americans. There would be latinos. There would be muslims, and anyone else.. Not just white people. I saw the available characters and I told him to shut it down. We decided to play l4d2 instead, a survival game with actual minds put behind it. Take some responsibility, you are the face of a generation. You can make the change, if you have an open mind, open heart, and bravery. It's a shame that so many these days do not though.",1485944884,False

Each season is different from eachother, meaning different tempatures, different bosses, different enemies and mobs, depending on seasons. There are also caves and ruins that you can explore! And of course, they have lots of different treasures! You can also get in-game drops, which are purely cosmetic and do not give any benefit to the player other than cosmetic reasons. You do not have to spend a dime in game, you can just play normally and gain drops by playing! Which is an another plus.

76561198864095457,"One of my favorite games. Strong mechanics especially survival ones in an industry studded with survival games where survival is more of an annoyance than a strength. It took me around 500 hours to really start to feel like I was good, and I can't wait to see what else the game throws at me.   Outside of that, the graphics are very stylised and fit the theme and feel of the game, and the devs have taken simple mechanics like kiting and cooking and made them into something really special that most games don't give you.   Overall 8/10 due to some issues with Maxwells nose being way too small and the community being way too nice.  Try not to starve :)",1578806769,True

Honestly before I even go into detail, buy the game if you love not only the art style, but the survival genre in general. This game does have some flaws, such as the occasionally crash or connectivity issues, but for the most part, Klei have made an amazing thing with this. If you're a fan of the original Don't starve and it's gameplay, then you will feel right at home here. However, your home is no longer an issue.  Now your house is full of your friends and even some strangers, how'd they get here, allowing you and the others to either work together or against each other. For the most part the player base is very nice to each other. Of course some people won't be a saint, but very few people will be mad if you're a new player. While playing online, if someone joins my server that is new I teach them the basics and let them discover the game for themselves.  The items in the game are a nice addition of character cosmetics. Now this is not a perfect game and isn't for everyone, but if you are curious about this game, my advice is to try it. This game is something fun to do and meet people on. The survival is refined and keeps the player engaged and planning with its in game seasons. Overall, this game is definitely a 8.5-9/10. This game is the survival game to just hang out and relax on with your friends. The key is to never really worry about ""playing the game wrong.""

76561198171111282,As far as survival games go this is one of the better ones in my opinion. Unlike Minecraft this game's difficultly very much increases when night falls thus making defense preparation and strategy making a much higher priority. This coupled with the hunger and sanity levels being a core focus of the game and directly effecting gameplay makes it quite an enjoyable experience. I also found the Seasonal Changes to be quite an enjoyable element of the game limiting what resources are available and can be collected at any given time. In addition the multiplayer feature of the game is solid and with the game's lower system requirements it can be played on any modestly powerful IBM Compatible PC. So for those of you who want a fun strategy/survival game you can play with friends I'd say it's worth your time and money.,1578527905,True

She's not a gamer at all, so I needed a more simple game that would be fun for her while also being challenging for me, but that I wouldn't have to just carry her through it.  We just got it recently, but this game has been great for that. It's simple enough with the scavenge and build mechanic that it's pretty easy to understand. I take over more of the combat which can be difficult at times, especially when you both get swarmed. Overall, it's a great game to play together, especially since we're long distance.

I have not played the new ""Return of Them"" update though it looks to have expanded the end game. [h2] The First 20 Hours [/h2] Don't Starve Together begins at its best: as a treacherous adventure.  Building a routine, discovering the behavior of strange creatures, and responding to unseen events slowly increases your confidence that you can beat your previous record.  However, you will likely die due to a lack of preparation every new season.  I believe that this stage of the game holds up for both solo and group players. However, be careful how you build your group.   [b] An experienced player should not introduce a new player to this game [/b].  My attempts to have new friends join result in me warning them of the dangerous surprises that are supposed to be overcome.  It is obviously much more fun mismanaging your base and starving together than having someone tell you how to play. [h2] 20 - 60 Hours [/h2] During this stage, it was important to me that I played with a group.  Routine days, where you could just chat with friends, are punctuated by engaging encounters.  At this stage, the nuances Klei have filled their world up with begin to surface.  Some of these details can be utilized to expand your base and some just make the world feel richer. [h2] 60 Hours & On [/h2] This game has a lot of content and I already got a lot of hours.  However, you know you're not going to die unless you start taking risks at this point.  If you're planning on dominating your world, then there is still a lot of content.  However, I was really only interested in overcoming the survival challenge. [h2] Conclusion [/h2] Don't Starve Together was one of the best games I've played.  I suggest you find at one person who has the same level of experience in the game as you and you'll get more than your money's worth.",1578512034,True

So much new content with every update in the form of new characters, character reworks, expansions, new skins, and more. The developers really listen to community feedback and the player base for the most part is generally pleasant. As for the game itself:  IF you like survival games and appreciate the charming hand drawn style of Don't Starve, you should definitely pick this up either at full price or when it goes on sale (It's a steal either way as you get TWO copies of the game, one for you and to give to a friend, at least at the time of writing this review). I will not lie, it will be a bit tough starting out when everything is new and wants to kill you. Playing with other people, trial and error, and learning as I go has helped me survive for much longer. Don't be afraid to read stuff up online. You also have the option to play by yourself if you prefer it that way.   In short:  [b]Get this game. You'll definitely get your money's worth.",1577947551,True

76561197995427764,"Probably the most easily fixable but completely broken and unplayable pub game I have ever played, GREAT with friends, but I am talking about the public servers here. All manner of griefer creative and uncreative plague the public servers, they do all manner of things stupid to ruin the experience and are like a cancerous plague on the game. The problem is this happens with any online survival game where douchery is possible and completely un-policed and it is up to the creator of the game to do something about it. Klei does absolutely nothing.  There is no report feature to send reports of players to get them banned from the actual game (so at least they would have to buy another copy), instead it is up to people to have to CONSTANTLY kick and rollback servers, and that only deals with the blatant and stupid griefing (willow base igniters), the smart ones will show up in waves to servers that have managed to get decent amount of days in and show up wasting your resources, eating all your shit, and taking all manner of things from your chests then logging off 2-3 days later. This ""noob"" behavior is not something you can easily call griefing but it is and most of them know what they are doing, but it could easily be controlled with minimal effort by Klei.  It is very easily preventable. Where is the report feature? Where is the Klei policing of this game, YOU DECIDED TO MAKE IT A PUBLIC ONLINE GAME! IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO POLICE THIS. Sure playing with friends is great, but that is not the only part of the game.  My main issue isn't even actually the report function it is simple basic anti-douche functions like: 1. Disallowing players from hammering or setting fire to buildings they did not create, unless they have been in the server for 10-15 dst days. EASY FIX. 2. Disallowing players from accessing chests they did not create unless they have been in the server for 10-15 dst days. EASY FIX 3. Disallowing players from accessing fridges they did not create unless they have been in the server for 10-15 dst days. EASY FIX 4. Disallowing players from picking up crops planted by other players unless they have been in the server for 10-15 days. EASY FIX  There are some examples.  Increase cosmetic rewards significantly for people who play for good periods during winter, spring, and summer. Massively decrease the gifts cosmetic rewards for people playing during autumn (or even disable it during this time). This will stop the roaming bands of absolute degenerate dick faces who constantly fill autumn server after autumn server after autumn server take all the resources and then log off 2-3 days into winter. This happens CONSTANTLY, it is EXTREMELY RIDICULOUS DIFFICULT to get a good game going that progresses through winter spring and summer, and when you do the griefers love to show up and use all manner of shittery to screw it up.  These are all really simple and basic fixes, and together would eliminate about 90%+ of the griefing and in general shitty behavior in the game, but my issue is Klei doesn't do a fucking thing.  I want to play the game, but without friends who play this type of game I am done with it.",1577833618,False

I'm new to Steam and while I've bought other games to play with my SO, I'd consider this the game that really got me invested and familiar with Steam.   I'm still trying to figure out what my preferred game attributes are, but wanted to find something that I would really love. I know the most time I spend in most of my games and the most fun that I have with them is in collecting and building things. When I searched ""Collecting"" in the steam store, ""Don't Starve"" was right on the first page and only a few dollars, so I figured I'd give it a try.   I was sucked in pretty hard pretty fast. My SO saw me playing it and immediately bought it. Then we found out there was a don't starve together and we have been plastered to our screens playing it together or playing our own figuring it out since.   The fandom site is forever open with at least 5 tabs on my second monitor.   This game has really opened up so much more for me than just the game. I had no idea how to host a game, I was intimidated by mods, I was at a total loss for navigating this whole site.  Well. Not anymore. I would recommend getting the game achievements mod since it gives you little goals instead of just wandering around, though I easily have 20 others running on this.   Despite how much time I've been on this, I still feel like I haven't done or explored even half of what this game has to offer. I've barely spent any time in the caves and have yet to find the ruins, I still haven't built all the machines and there is just so much to do and figure out. And I'm so excited about it.   Bigger picture about this game is if you're new to steam, PC gaming or gaming in general, this is your easy entry gateway drug. If you're trying to pull someone into gaming with you, but they're intimidated and don't want to throw down a ton of cash or deal with anything super complicated, get this game. If you want a fun game to play with friends, get this game. It's for everyone of every level. My SO has probably played more games than I've seen in my lifetime and they're just as hooked as I am.   I plan on discovering every detail of this game before giving it up, but I've already bought this company's whole collection for after that happens. Cannot recommend enough.",1577553884,True

76561198104084485,"This game is very simple on the surface. Don't fucking starve, its in the title you dolt. Unfortunately not starving gets boring eventually. Good news friend, there is much more to do in this game than just not starving. Going in with no knowledge you will likely die horrible death after horrible death. This is a great learning experience, and makes your overall transformation into a wizened, self-sustained, god king all the more satisfying. That's when you head down to the caves or fight a boss you thought you were ready for. You were not ready. This is the point when you will realize that after over 200 hours combined between this game and base don't starve and expansions, you barely scratched the surface of the game. And thus begins the process of getting the shit kicked out of you all over again and having to run home a defeated and with your ham bat shoved neatly up your rump. Great game 10/10.",1577264647,True

For people like me who have work to deal with and have weak willpower, it's better to have a clear cognition before playing. There is no wonder that the world needs a little exploration and survival. As a novice to play this game, the biggest feeling is that it's too difficult, it's just the difficulty of nightmares. There will always be some events in the game that make you fall short of success, or hinder you from peaceful development. Novices are not familiar with the game mechanism, and there is no novice tutorial in the game. If you want to play a good famine, you have to watch video strategies or wiki. The initial development is the most difficult. Death is a common thing, but you can't revive when you die. The best way is to use rollback to play the day before.

76561198835635538,"Don't Starve is one of my favourite games of all time. It scratches every itch in terms of open world base building, beautiful Tim Burton art style and unique characters each with their own skill set. The DLCs each offer exciting expansions to the main game and are absolutely worth purchasing and provide hours of fun. I've played over 100 hours of this game, many more if you include the expansions and original Don't Starve, and will forever play more, you never run out of content and Klei just keep adding more.  Don't judge it wrong, It isn't as easy as it may appear, and some areas of the game (e.g. the ruins, Dragonfly and very long term survival) provide a high skill ceiling, especially if you go it alone, and will take some time to be able to reach.   My biggest issue with the game is the length of time new content updates take and they are often delayed for months at a time. However, the developers make sure anything they put to the live servers is fully tested and of the highest quality so they should be commended for that, despite it being frustrating.   Another small problem is older servers can become laggy.   This game enables a MASSIVE range of mods which greatly improve or change the gameplay. You can get them on the Steam Workshop for free.   If you've gone as far as to click this game, stop wasting time on reviews and just purchase it. You won't regret it.",1576874274,True

76561198040402436,"TL:DR: The tagline is a good description.  Well-developed, unique, fascinating, and highly replayable.  Highly recommend.  There are few games as unique in feel as this one.  I love games where the learning curve kills you about 100 times before it shallows.  It's really a challenge to even figure out what you're looking at.  The game mechanics take a while to learn if you jump in with no reading about the game, but that's the fun part to a large degree.  Great characters each with fatal flaws to overcome.  Great balancing, with many different survival strategies.  One of the best features of this game is a development team that's really on the ball.  The updates come from servers that send you the updates quickly.  The updates are usually small and minor because of how well built the game is.  The devs listen to the community and it has great support.  This situation will never happen with Don't Starve: Me: ""Okay, what to play?  I think I'll play some Ark tonight!"" Ark: *klaxXxon* ""2GB update-that-basically-does-nothing-and-certainly-doesn't-fix-any-bugs-and-downloads-at-the-speed-of-molasses required!"" Me: ""Well, ****.  I guess I'll download it overnight...I guess I could play something else..."" Also me in the morning: ""Well, ****. the updates still not done.  Their servers suck...""",1576790006,True

The only gripe I have and the number one problem plaguing it for years is the lack of constant flint spawning in the primary spawning area or providing some for starting players as a default. The vast majority of players have trouble finding flint 2-3 days into a server because of hoarding and inevitably die as a consequence. This has never been addressed and leads to an off putting experience when entering a server that is several days ahead. This is a problem for beginners and has potentially led to many just checking out.,1576701988,True

76561198148759883,"This game is a great example of an open world sandbox survival action-adventure ish game. This game allows you to do whatever the fuck you want while also being very uncompromising if you're incompetent . Playing with other friends make this experience way more enjoyable and replayable, while playing along is bearable, it is much harder to survive this way if you are inexperienced so grab some friends and bear the inevitable. The art style this game uses is truly unique. Never in a game have I been so captivated by all the characters, animals, and even items. To second that, the soundtrack in this game is amazing, the music is crazy catchy and will get stuck in your head, each song that places for certain actions you take are very memorable, probably because they play over and over again but regardless, this unique style of music is done to perfection. The amount of knowledge you need for the game is endless, setting up each season to be able to survive it is enjoyable for the most part while taking down bosses might be tedious, you can find many ways to kill them differently, some more effective than others of course. All in all, a great game for people who are willing to learn through the hardships of failing to survive from all the elements of this game.",1576488585,True

76561198188392807,"A good game that recently has been bringing new content.   Although sometimes being a letdown like the Forge for example. I like the battle arena and I guess I understand why it's not always there. But I expected it to be an introduction to a new area in the game. Where they are coming to invade from a portal and if left alone they would expand to make a base on this side of the portal while creating a new biome through the portal they came from. The base would occasionally send search parties to explore and if they find they could also send some attack parties like the dog waves. Also expected those new mini bosses, that could be soloed.  Also experiencing problems during combat that could use some hotfixes for example: - Charlie hitting me instantly once it becomes night. As you know it should be a while before Charlie appears when losing light and even then there's a few warnings letting you know to find light before she hits you. That didn't happen a few times and she ended up hitting me soon as it got dark.  - Inconsistency with tentacles popping out to attack you when it should always be the same amount of time. Where there's a few seconds when near a tentacle that it would come out to attack you when you're near. Sometimes it's random like coming out as you got close as if you were close the whole time thus attacking you. Or you confirmed a spot is safe because no tentacles popped out for at least a minute, at night, then it pops out. Might be related to the issue with bats and bees where they fly around and glitch the tentacle into staying asleep.  - Just recently a Terrorbeak hit and killed me even though I perfectly kited him = basically still hit me even though I dodged and was out of range. There was also an instance where a Terrorbeak kept reappearing on top of me constantly and after the 5th hit? it would ignore dissipating and just attack me. And as you know hitting shadows should always make them dissipate, a simple fix would be not to let them reappear within a certain distance from the character.  Edit- just found out it it has more to do with time where depending how much time has passed. When you kite moving away from mob and going back in the amount of time it takes to go back to hit depends if you're going to get hit or not. For example, you're able to hit werepig 3 times and safely back off if you're fast enough. Messing it up by being slower will let werepig hit but the issue is ping so safer just to attack twice.  Edit- ping, I like to use force attack and have it modded to not attack friendly things. However there's a ping issue where there's a delay for the character to carry out the action I made it do, however short, it's not instant. Because of that it totally effects the kiting in this game making it somewhat unplayable.  Edit- Mobs pushing each other is stupid, where you have multiple mobs aggro on you. When they attack they would usually miss since you're running without stopping but because the other mobs behind push it, it's range magically extends hitting you. Fix by causing them to be unmovable once attacking.  - Also dogs, and this is more of a nuisance of wasting time, where you don't know how many barks they would do sometimes it's once maybe it's twice or it could be that rare 4 or 5 times. It's a waste of time since you're there thinking how many barks will he do? should I attack him? just always bark twice  - Another problem is how far some mobs will chase you, like I was once stalked by a tallbird for like 2-3 biomes away, sure I stole it's egg but cmon f*** OFF Felicia. How you expect me to lose aggro when they're faster and always catch up & re-aggroing.  Edit - Then there's the bees... hassle and a pain to clear them off whether kiting or tanking. They all swarm to attack you once in range, and the bug of pushing each other is present. On the one hand kiting is time consuming and they the respawns are too short so it'll take a while to clear one hive. Tanking wastes of resources on making armor just to get honey, make bee box,etc.Instead they could make them swarm around the player like bats and attack in waves. Let's say there's 6 then 3 groups of 2s take turns attacking. When the first group of 2 attack whether hit or miss as they're going out the second group goes in to attack and it keeps going like that. Also the bees respawn should take longer or even easier starts after the last bee was killed.Then it goes back to regular spawn where the first killed spawns first,etc.. There's also a bug where killer bees don't count out even when attacking their bees within hive range, soon as i attack hive 2 come out. It happened back to back on 2 killer bee hives and on the second i died. wasted 2+ days and 2 full pig helmets just to get 5 honeycomb and the 6th killed me.  Seriously I don't know why they have kiting combat since there's tons of problems with it.",1576451817,True

Recommend using the Wiki or guides and starting with the standard experience. Also would recommend some mods that improve the UI and some information given in the game.

Either take on this harsh world known to us as The Constant by yourself, or continue on through your adventures with the aid and support of allies. Figure out certain character match ups and synergies to get the most out of your partner, or just hop in blind as someone you like the look of and check out where the wind ( Or the sea ) takes you. There is really no limit to how you survive, the habits you go about each day, or the way you make your base, or, really anything! If you're struggling, try out Endless mode for less stress when dying. If you're like me, you'll just whip up the wiki every time you get curious about how something works, or you may be willing to find it out yourself, or even make guides for others on the internet.  Whatever you choose your playstyle to be, make sure to have fun. That's why we play games in the first place, is it not?

In addition to the fact with mod ability, the fun is just unlimited. Now onto the negatives. As I stated before, this game is hard. As a big learning curve in my opinion. Its not a game for the gamers that want an easy time game. This however is not new, the entire Don't Starve series is just like that and Hamlet is by far the worst.

76561198240906842,"Definitely a good buy. I was attracted to this game because of the art style, and it's truly something special. Though, I'd appreciate some updates to certain characters who haven't received very much love for a while (I could be wrong, don't quote me on this), such as Wilson, Wolfgang, Wigfrid, etc.. Another letdown is the Turn of Tides update, the water mechanics are very hard to get used to. It's near impossible to turn a boat away from hitting something without using an anchor, and the anchor is extremely hard (at least for me) to lower, and sometimes you still hit it regardless.

It takes patience and time to learn the game as the game itself is overall unexplained and throws you into a world to figure out how to survive.

I ended up getting it for about $8-9 I believe, along with another copy to send to a friend which I thought was a cool way to promote a mulitplayer game. Even at normal price I would've still bought it. After the ""is it worth your money"" section, the game runs well; it does have problems but is okay from my personal experience. It has a whole slew of characters with different personalities. There are characters behind paywalls but you can get them for like $2 by buying items on the market. I've had so many hours of enjoyment from this game. I would pick it up if you and/or a friend would like to play a fun single/multi player game.",1575837575,True

Get a few friends together, find a nice place to set up camp and see how long you can survive against the terrors of this strange, fantastical land you find yourselves in.   With simple controls, fantastic, astonishing artwork, beautiful music and really positive, interactive community - truly a unique game. It has a lot to offer, with many hidden gems to discover. Developer build something so simple and nonetheless addictive despite it being a game without a particular goal.  The game has a long learning curve and it's really unforgiving to new players, it doesn't have a tutorial and makes you figure things out for yourself so you will need to spend some time researching how to play. You will be thrown into a harsh and unpredictable environment, every decision you make will directly impact whether u survive another day or die. Your abilities will constantly be tested so you will have to adapt to the current situation and prepare for the hard seasons. You will also have to learn from past mistakes and come up with a better solution that best fits your character and playstyle. You have to cater to sanity, hunger, and health, by collecting and crafting items from around the map which changes with each new world made, allowing for the player to explore new areas, or make different strategies based on their environment. Keeping the nightmares at bay with all the cool stuff you learned to craft. There’s a massive fun factor in discovering new ways to survive in the creepy little land of Don’t Starve.  The amount of options when creating a server is stunningly detailed and easy to navigate. You can choose all sorts of thing, from how many animals there are, how much food there is, how long the day/night is...   Downloading mods is highly recommended since mods are one of the best parts of the game. There are numerous characters to download on the steam workshop and other really fun and useful mods which can benefit you survive.

Most of our play through's have ended with valuable lessons being learned, meaning we had to restart.

We're barely getting to the point of crafting all of the games items and we're almost at 170 hours of played!

Once you actually manage that, you recognize that to survive winter you must get even better in fall and build a stash, preserve food, build better barricades, make more efficient recipes, etc.  When you finally got over winter... after many attempts, you think spring will be a charm, because finally, food can be gathered again! This is when the first actual boss showed up.  The different characters feel very unique, and require different tactics to play with.  Will gladly die aggain, 10/10 stars.",1575305609,True

76561198052791530,"Can highly recommend this game, I played Don't Starve single player since it's alpha release can't say i've bought most of the single player DLCs but Don't Starve Together gives you the chance to enjoy the DLC features without spending as much money. This game can be enjoyed single player or in a group both feel great, single player ""can"" be overwhelming for new players as the boss health scales differently on DST but very fun if you know what your doing. I will say i was given DST for free because i owned DS single player since alpha, How ever i do still recommend it for it's price DLC characters don't feel too overpowered and it's just as easy/challenging with a DLC character vs with a non DLC character.  One of the strong points of DST vs DS is that there are different/newer characters to add spice to your game play. I do own all the ""DLC"" characters all of which are enjoyable in their own right. DST is seemingly constantly being updated which is very nice as well.  Mod support is pretty strong within this community most of which can easily be installed via steam and activated in game. Mods range from characters to mobs to even weather and effects, most of which are easy to install.  All and all i'd say 8/10 it's a fun game if you like these types of games, the art style is great the music is great. But after playing it over and over again it can get a bit boring but that's the same for any game. Also fuck the deer clops.",1575293386,True

Playing it with a few friends is even more fun. You fight, survive and overcome difficult situations together. The survival aspect of the game may be a little frustrating at the beginning. You would find yourself dying a lot for the most of the time. I know how annoying that really is, I've been there before. The game is really tough in the beginning. Every time you approach to something new, you will get slapped by the game very hard. The main purpose of the game is trying to survive as long as you can. The game will try to kill you no matter what, keep that in mind. Patience is the key. When you start learning the major aspects of the game and get more experienced, the game becomes much more enjoyable. You will gain more and more information about all the little details and expand your knowledge to a greater level. After playing for a while you will realise that you overcome the toughest situations a lot easier than before. That is the reason why I love this game a lot. Its gameplay has this challenging gameplay that always keeps you thinking what to do next. The action never stops. You have to know what to do next, in order to survive.         The developers of this game still working hard. They update it frequently and add new features to the game.  Also there is all a lot of cool mods for this game in the steam workshop. The mod developers are also great. Their ideas and creativity is really amazing. You should check them out if you are interested in adding original and great features to the game.    I would say that this game has so much potential. And it still keeps growing. I would definitely recommend this game. It is a great game. Klei takes such a great care of their little baby.

This is definitely my favourite indie game I have played.  Don't Starve is an incredibly good game, it has great depth and incredible replayability. There are many different characters you can unlock, each with unique traits that will make replaying this game continiously enjoyable. I would highly recommend buying this game, even if it is not on sale, although it does go on sale frequently.  The DLC Reign of Giants expands upon the world of Don't Starve by making the game even more challenging, by adding 2 more seasons, Spring and Autumn and reworking Summer to be much more difficult. It adds many new items that can change the way you survive. And with the new mechanic of smoldering items in Summer, the game gets a lot more difficult. I would also highly recommend purchasing this DLC because it adds an incredible amount of content to the game.",1575193553,True

I get it that singleplayer versions would become obsolete, but it's not about the games itself, it's about the fun players have and how much it would skyrocket if you could play with friends. Just my opinion, though.  DST is very unfriendly towards new players. A lot of information to process and pretty much every new thing you learn must be paid with a death. And without mods you basically must start anew every time.  Without its wikipedia one would need several months to learn what every character does and every single one's weaknesses. It really burns you out if you die at every blind step, to something the game doesn't even attempt explaining.  But fear not! Mods are here to help! There are a lot of mods that make the game very very very enjoyable! Especially with friends that is. It's a difficult game, but there is a lot of content and a lot of places to explore, build around, plan around and a lot of things you GOTTA RUN FROM AAAAAAHHHH.  With a bit of mod help you can turn deaths into simple consequences and not game overs. Play a run, with or without friends, with said failsafes. Explore first, challenge yourself later.  Its artstyle is very unique and simple. I can't get enough of it. The game is constantly updated and kept in shape. There is no reason not to give this game a try. At first there will be many inconveniences, but explore and also look up mods after a few playthroughs. Everyone has a rough beginning, a flaw I'd say, but as mentioned before, it is worth it.

But for every failure, I learn something new about the game, and it never ceases to amaze me how much I still have not yet uncovered. To this day there are still updates, events, and new content that keep things interesting, and it's genuinely my favourite game to teach new people. Klei, I love you guys.

Its a rite of passage to prove you are competent enough at this game, to survive and explore for that period of time till u find the base. And also to protect the base from griefers and thieves.  On the same note, even if u find base, don't simply give out the location in chat. Unless u built the base from day 1.  3. Don't grief or steal. If you want anything just ask nicely.

Singleplayer is optional but I would highly recommend getting ""Don't Starve"" for it's extra DLC . If you play on a random server you just gotta hope for the best and expect the worst because you could end up playing with novice/lone wolf players or great teammates. When you got good team synergy going you can take on the tough world and it's many beast, scoring quality loot to craft top tier gear. Beating any of the many bosses is always a satisfying feeling and can be easily done with some strategy and friends. Or you could get massacred and have a laugh. I would describe the combat as OG Zelda-esque that is heavily relying on the gear/items you craft to boost your stats {damage,armor). The combat is deeper than it seems at first glance. if you like shoot/blast/beat 'em ups you might not like this. Combat is much slower paced and takes strategy. There is elemental damage, magic, ranged, aoe, and even a couple of . If combat isnt your thing you could craft traps or recruit npc's to fight on your behalf or help your teammates by playing to the strengths of the variety of support class character(healer, cook, farmer, builder, etc).

76561198060391080,"Oh. Don't Starve. This game has been a years long love/hate affair for me. Will this game frustrate you to no end and make you want to throw your computer against the wall? Absolutely. But you also won't be able to put the darn thing down until you finish it. This may take longer than expected. If you like survival games, sandbox games, atmospheric horror, this is for you. Other than a few minor persistent bugs, the gameplay is solid and enjoyable whether you are on PC, phone, or tablet. It is pretty consistent between devices.  I love the challenge of the game and the fact that you can scale the difficulty up or down in really dynamic ways depending on your skill level, whether you're playing with people new to survival games, or how silly you want it to be. The graphics are great, the customization of character and world is rewarding, and I feel like each gameplay experience offers me something new. I've been playing for years and am still discovering new, hilarious, and infuriating ways to die. For example, I was delighted to discover that you can damage a spider by lighting it on fire with an attack from a torch. I was not so pleased to find out that said spider will rampage all around the base and burn the whole thing to the ground. Back to the drawing board.  Seriously, give this game a try. There's something for everyone. Whether you like cute creatures, spooky atmosphere, designing houses, being a murder hobo and stabbing your friends in the back, or just need a semi-casual game to play on the John, this is worth the money. I think I got mine on sale but I honestly would have played $30 for it. You will get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of this (think Skyrim).",1573848557,True

This game is very mod-friendly and it‘s easy to tweak things by urself even though experienced modding requires sime tutorials. Because there are a lot of mods in the work shop this game never really gets boring. Oh and servers: U can find servers to play in easily with settings and that‘s one of my favorite things.

76561198272018011,"After 100 entertaining hours on this game, here's my review. (Would have done it earlier but this masterpiece needs a good review).   11/10.  Don't starve together, has to be one of the best games i've actually ever played, like, you have the choice of going full solo, or no friends, or with friends, EITHER WAY, ITS FUN. The game comes with workshop mod support which leads to COUNTLESS content, even klei entertainment itself updates the game nonstop and that's just countless more and more content. Nothing is pay2win either, skins/rare skins can be earned through ACTUAL survival gameplay, and daily reward, also watching any dst twitch streams with your account linked gives you skins!  But why is this game so much fun? Well its because of variety. There's nonstop shit to learn,master, and experience. You never know what's gonna come out of that sinkhole or what this weird cute mob is gonna do to you, enough said, buy the game, its really good.",1573387763,True

76561198157843963,"Don't Starve Together would be an actually unforgiving game if it wasn't for other players base building independently from you, simply by bumping into another player while in a bad situation means they can either share your fate, you can try passing the mobs attacking you onto them or you both flee, if you follow them long enough you'd find a base or at the very least a campfire for the night (unless they use a torch or other light source).  As far as balance goes I can't recommend single player without mods as the enemies/bosses are scaled up based on player count and as such taking on anything solo without mods is practically suicide unless you're really good at kiting.. even knowing the default movesets for a boss in normal Don't Starve doesn't help so much here as in some cases there are new attacks or outright completely different strategies they use (dragonfly in DST for example is like a mini raid boss).  I can recommend this safely if you like this kind of game and if you're prepared to learn to survive on your own, you'll need some adaptability to prepare for winter and summer safely, caves are suicide for newer players unless you camp the entrance and the rest of the biomes are not too dangerous unless you wander into swamps unprepared.  You do need armour in game to take hits and you shouldn't try to rely on other players as you'll be restricting your own freedom and the best way to learn is to do it yourself or in the presence of somebody more experienced.. so in short you can rely on people for food/rest but don't expect anybody to keep you alive out of obligation, if anything it's more likely due to if you die then your ghost will hit everybody else alive with a sanity draining aura that only goes when you revive.  Overall a great game and i expected nothing less from Klei to be honest, they really know how to make a fun experience alone or with friends and also the game is still being added to and updated so I can recommend this for the long term also. Not going to go into the characters or the balance of them here but the cast is varied and I feel safe enough saying that odds are there is one you will like maybe not at first but eventually and if it clicks (world or character) then you'll be in this for a long time.  Ah and also buying this game nets you 1 free steam gift copy of the game so your friend that is also interested can also join your adventures, there is honestly nothing I can recommend more for survival co-op than this at the moment.. heck I wouldn't want to either this game does so much right and the devs go above and beyond with what they're doing here, if you don't like this particular game at least browse through their other products they really are amazing.",1573382315,True

76561198267328424,"Great game. The developers actually listen and have done a great job evolving the game to what it is today. I started with Don't Starve, before it came onto Steam so I am a long time fan. I was one of many who hoped for a multiplayer version of DS back then and after Don't Starve Together finally came out I've been so happy with it as well as my friends. It is a fun, complex and challenging game and the developers are able to find ways to keep the game interesting while amazing mods for it exist. It has been an awesome experience over the years. There are awesome game mechanics that need to be in EVERY survival game. There's depth to each character and their individual in-game advantages/disadvantages done very well. Surviving with others is great fun, like being a Wickerbottom to farm and create books while a Maxwell does resource gathering with his shadow minions, and book reading. The game rewards those that are observant and can think outside the box, like dropping stacks of food near werepigs for manure or spooking spiders for a guaranteed gland.  There are thousands of things to explore in DST but it's all wrapped in a simple package. My kid has pretty much grew up with DST and is as big a fan as I am. We still look forward to each update.

To this day 7 years later, it is still one of my  all time favorites and i own Dont starve (both original and together) on steam, xbox, and even mobile(just original). I love the art style (very tim burtonesque but not at the same time) its a great survival game, but not the kind that will make you piss yourself from somthin sneakin up on ya ( im a wuss). DST has some great things from the original and theyve added a bunch of neat content thats exclusive to this version (just sayin the characters would be dope on single player too klei) im Kleis biggest fan and i wish i could just veg out on this game all the time but sadly i am an adult now and have to do adult shit like have a crappy job and pay bills. 10/10 100/10 tbh this is the best game and if youre even reading this, fuckin buy it. you wont be disappointed",1573112356,True

Resources can be scarce, time is sometimes thin for said resources, and you are either running low on your hunger (wow, who would've guessed that would be in the game) or sanity. The first few times playing may be hard, and you wipe earlier on; this is a game of learning from your mistakes.  Of course, the game also gives customization options for your characters, so you don't necessarily need to always look like the base character. Loot drops occur at least once per day on starting up, and some time after playing in a game.  The game does have microtransactions, one category being the DLC characters, the other being cosmetics. Of course there are plenty characters in the base game to enjoy, so unless you really want them, you don't need to buy the characters.

76561198077288701,"I am going to say that I do recommend this game, at least under certain circumstances.   The game itself (at least from my experience) isn't that different from normal don't starved aside from certain mods or dlc that can be used. So if you are just running solo, you don't have to get the game. Of course, you can just play solo on this too except if you play solo on a game with ""together"" in the name it feels kinda lonely (help me) so yeah.  Now, if you are playing this with friends, it makes everything so much better (to an extent, will explain later). The multiplayer aspect of the game changed how I played. I normally just hide away from creatures and avoid fights unless absolutely necessary. When I played with friends however, we'd kite creatures and constantly swap aggro if possible and when it wasn't possible, we'd just all rush in and the monster would usually do less damage than it would have normally. We were also able to divvy out tasks for each person. One could hunt for food, another could tend the farm, the third could be cutting down trees, the fourth could be getting stone, etc. It became a very well oiled machine. It can also become very repetitive. As survival games go, Don't Starve Together can be very harsh if you are unprepared. Given how it is a multiplayer game and it can be modded? It becomes almost impossible to survive if you are the wrong character or if you are simply unprepared and with multiple people running it for the first time, it has/causes problems.  During my first few runs with my friends, the first time we made it to winter we had two choices, die of starvation or die of cold. We had been concerned with just surviving temporarily and forgot all about winter and nearly paid the price because we didn't have enough materials to make more than 1 coat/hat. The person going out had to get enough food for 3 people and go get flint for axes. Next winter we had the same problem as we had two new arrivals and we had to now feed and clothe 5 people. It was a very painful existence but I will say the chaos was fun which is why I am recommending this even if it is difficult with several people.  Although, if you have the first game and is considering this one? I don't know how much I can help with that as I don't really play the normal Don't Starve.",1572916239,True

76561197993594429,"Why I play this game: Crunchy, satisfying sound effects. Animations are squishy and stretchy. Also satisfying. Thrilling, gritty dangers. No gore or jumpscares. Just running for your life. Specific elements can be reduced or turned off, for anyone tired of dying to That Thing too many times. Specific elements can be boosted or extra boosted, for when an ordinary amount of carrots simply isn't enough. Or if you wanted to die to That Thing even more times. No copy-paste content. Enemies/items all behave differently. Seasons change graphics + survival challenges, so it doesn't get stale. Permanent cosmetics earned via playtime. Light your hair on fire to assert dominance. It's a funny world. Even your own beard is a valuable resource. Map generator keeps it fresh. Some worlds are more terrifying than others. Like the one that spawned 50 aggressive beehives in a single field. The game supports mods! In case a vanilla-flavored death wasn't intense enough for you.  It says it's a survival game, but let's be honest, dying in tragic or absurd ways is a pretty big part of the game. If you can't laugh about it when your entire base burns to the ground, it might not be the game for you. There's a rollback recovery option for maps, but it's rather likely you'll experience camp obliteration sometimes, particularly while learning how the game works. If you can shrug that off, overall, the game is very, very satisfying.",1572598195,True

You don't have to be good to come far in the game but if you kill all the bosses and don't waste your time just walking around you can get your hands on some better gear and get more prepard for the next season.

I originally got into the alpha/beta of the original Don't Starve not expecting a whole ton but found a wonderful addition to the survival genre. Don't Starve Together is almost like a sequel to Don't Starve and the title does not necessarily mean you have to play with others to succeed as it is still a great game to play alone. The Don't Starve series prides itself on being difficult to learn and that is not a bad thing as once the mechanics are learned, they stick creating a smarter player base that constantly teaches each other how to survive better. Don't let the first hour or even five hours let you down, look around and find out how to play. Knowledge is power in these games which is why fighting is the best of any survival game as you have to learn how to outplay the enemy by use of kiting techniques. I could go on and on about why this game deserves a look, but instead here's the TLDR.  TLDR: The game is fantastic, give it a go and learn from those who have survived before you.",1572017538,True

Will say a lot of how enjoyable of your game is can depend on how lucky you are with a spawn.  Characters are all really fun. You can get addicted to playing one or switch between different characters each with unique perks that make it easier or harder to survive depending the circumstances.  Friends really add to the game but not required. As all games it's a lot easier communicating through voice since typing is hard when you're getting chased by a pack of feral dogs.  The game can be quite unforgiving at times with your stats being hard to get up without the right stuff but that's one of the things that can make it more fun if you like that kind of thing. If not, there's workshop support to basically alter or add anything you want.  Cosmetics: All DLC are cosmetics most of which you can weave for free by breaking down the free cosmetics you get. Even then though it's all really cheap especially compared to a lot of cosmetics these days (cough battle royal on origin I'm looking at you).

There are some parts of the characters and mechanics in the game that aren't immediatly explained but with a quick search or question to another player they can explain it easily. it also doesn't take long to learn at all. There is also thousands of mods that others have created to customize the game however you wish. for example, different music, want shovel knight? they got that. want paper mario? they got that too. there's thousands and Klei (the people that made this) promote mods made by the players and constantly update and balance the game so can have fun playing any character if you so choose.

The point is there is plenty to learn, explore, and die by.

The game can be somewhat confusing when you start off, but the community is so friendly and helping that I learnt pretty much everything in a matter of days.   in terms of difficulty, the game gets harder as the number of days increases. So it's a game that's easy to pick up but hard to master. Different characters have different mechanic and play styles, for an example, wortox can teleport, but his hunger drains faster than the other characters, so you and your teammates need to vary the way they play in order to survive.   The game also offers a lot of content. Items, bosses and a lot of status effects during different seasons (overheating during summer and freezing during winter), so you have to adapt. The bosses are tricky to take down as well, so you have to choose whether you want to take it down or run from it.   It has a great artstyle which really brings out the feeling of suffering the characters face throughout the game.   The devs update frequently to balance things out, add new characters, islands, mobs e.t.c.

76561198394104508,"This, along with Don't Starve itself, was my favorite game from ~2015 to late 2018. It has simple mechanics but endless replayability. It has rich lore and an immersive world, which is made complete by the stellar and completely novel art design. (Enough cannot be said about this game's art and sound design, which is absolutely unparalleled.)   I have well over 200 hours logged in this game and had a blast with each of them. It was joy to play with both friends and complete strangers, who more often than not were very nice and cooperative.   If you are a fan of survival games, are attracted by this game's unique art style, or are a Don't Starve veteran, then I cannot oversell this game to you.  It will easily grant you 50-100 hours of fun depending on your grit.   Past that, there is one caveat. After 200+ hours in this game, I found myself bored by it, as happens naturally with any game. I only play rarely nowadays, and always with friends. Real-life friends who you can share your experiences with and mentor through this challenging game are what makes this game, so if you have a dedicated friend or two to bring along, then I can doubly recommend this.

76561198800779299,"This twist on the original's formula makes for a fun multiplayer experience, especially with friends.   Pros: - Multiplayer with both friends, or through hosted/dedicated servers. - Amazing mod support in-game via the steam workshop. Server mods are universal to all players on that server (such as character mods), and client mods only changes your end (UI customization etc). - Large active playerbase means you will always find someone to play with. - Additional features not present in the single player version of the game, such as new or reworked bosses/areas. - Diverse cast of characters allows for neat combinations when playing with others. For example, Wickerbottom can craft spell books that have powerful effects such as regrowing farms/food. Wolfgang loves this, since he needs a LOT of food but is otherwise the strongest fighter of them all. - A ""progression"" system of sorts in the form of character cosmetics that are earn just by playing. If you don't care for these cosmetics, you can convert them into ""spools"" for other cosmetics, or even buying the 2 ""locked"" characters (Wortox+Wormwood) for free. - It's still being actively supported and still receiving free content updates at the time of writing this review.  Cons: - Can be a little laggy. While the game by default tries to ""predict"" movement client-side, it doesn't always work out and occasionally causes you to get hit from what feels like a mile away. - Public servers are prone to trolls who mess with others for the heck of it.

76561198070105594,"This is such a versatile game. Especially if you're willing to use mods, you can do basically anything here. Given the choice between Don't Starve or Don't Starve Together, I would go with Together. There's so much customization and the choice to play multiplayer is great.  The customization allows for a very broad range of difficulty levels. Want to kill all the bosses with minimal supplies? Go ahead. Want to have no bosses and unlimited respawns? Also an option! You can make it as hard or as easy as you want, I think that's the beauty of the game.  My biggest annoyance is that there's no way to cross the water, so sometimes you have to take massive detours. I tried finding a mod that let me make custom wormholes or something similar, but nothing seemed to work. Besides that, I don't really have anything negative to say about the game. Overall I'd say it's pretty well balanced and definitely enjoyable.

76561198060671680,"This is an absolutely amazing game. It can be endless hours of fun when you have friends to adventure the constant with. There is a steep learning curve but don't be swayed to stop playing because once you get past that first winter things start getting easier and with the bosses and base building there is tons to do. This is a hardcore survival game so that means if you die its game over but there are ways to get the world to continue progressing but that requires items. I have over 400 hours in this game and still find reasons to revisit it on the occasion to see how far or fast i can do things like beat some of those pesky bosses. In addition to that the devs constantly update the game and with new content on the way there are new adventures awaiting us all. Its a game I couldn't recommend more to the person looking for a nice relaxing evening of hardcore survival with a few good friends to chat with. Although with that in mind someone who likes constant action could still find this game to their liking as there are lots of mobs to hunt and with the forge you can find continuous action. With fighting nuances like kiting and different character mechanics I think this game could find a place in most people's hearts at least for awhile especially if you like other games such as Minecraft or Terraria since they all share the survival, crafting, and fighting elements.",1562076349,True

76561198322310064,"Now, I am gonna be honest with this game.  It was a great experience while trying to improve during my time with the game, and i can admit the developers care a lot of their creations.   The art is interesting, and really fitting with the theme they were going with the game. And it gives it it's sort of feel when you come across a certain mob, making some of them look threatning yet adorable at times. And most of the character skins and look shows a lot.  Now with the gameplay, while it is devastating when playing as a beginner, once you learn the basics then the core of the game, it can be really enjoying because it has a lot options and ways you can play the game, like you wanted to make the game more hard, do a sort of restriction in the game play, like a challenge. Now with the characters, they are very unique and all play a sort of role, for example, Wickerbottom can a supportive yet powerful game changing character, due to her having books which can skip all the wait and preparation for a certain supply or a fight. Now they all have a certain disadvantage which affects the character's stats and viability. Some of these characters could use a rework by any sort or change. Now with the rest of the game, it gives a sort of challenge in every season, autumn will usually be the starting season, and there will be no sort of disadvantage. Now with winter, it can be one of the most harshest seasons. Because if you are unprepared for winter, then there's barely any sort of chance for you to survive. Each season has their own disadvantage (Within the second coming of autumn, there is a seasonal boss which can be disastrous if not dealt with.) Which forces you to prepare for. The amount of knowledge and learning you have to go through from each season and enemies gives a feel of enjoyment because you are learning on how to fight through these game changing problems. The combat and enemies are nearly the most exiting parts yet most frustrating. You normally just take the damage, but in order to actually succeed taking a specific enemy, you have to learn to kite. It's normally doing damage to a enemy while not taking actual damage. And a lot of these enemies can be annoying, or can be easily dealt with. Bosses in these games are extremely enjoying, because you have to prepare and make sure any sort of disadvantage is dealt with. These bosses can be extremely punishing or extremely easy depending on your preparations. And each season has their own seasonal bosses, 2-3 of these seasonal bosses are a hassle to deal with if your not ready. One of them can be Deerclops, winter's seasonal boss. It breaks structures and tries to hunt down the player.   The multiplayer is great but has some problems. In multiplayer, you can join a variety of servers depending where you are living. And most of these can be searched from filtering and specifically searching it. You can also host your own, and add settings and changes to the server. When you join a certain server, everything is the same, besides there's players instead of a single one. You can chat with these players. What i would recommend for you to do is to find a server that is currently in the first autumn as in Day 1-10 that is team cooperating and social. This will guranteed give you a chance to survive with a team attempting to survive through these seasons. And each player has to be benefitting the team by doing the characters purpose and role.   Now the problems with multiplayer is annoying. I haven't found or discovered any sort of bugs, besides abusable ones. The main problem with game is normally beginners. Because most of the beginners just instantly go to multiplayer and not aware of being unexperienced with the game. And would be either kicked or just get carried, or stay dead then leave. Some players do teach these beginners and giving them tips, but mostly kick them for eating up resources and doing nothing or not fulfilling their role. For every beginner, i would absolutely recommend watching guides, tutorials from DST youtubers. The community itself, is alright. And the most frustrating part of multiplayer is griefers. Now this problem can be easily solved, and can be reversed when a griefer lights something on fire or hammers the base. But they can usually time their destruction to the next day, making rollback useless to reverse the damage. And the server will usually die. Some of these servers reset, deleting every piece of progress, starting it at day 1. The lag can be annoying but then just goes back to normal  Concluding this detailed review, i totally recommend this game because it has a lot of options and challenges to give, and can be very addictive and enjoying, as well with friends. And you can play in your style. If you are starting out in this game, i recommend just watching guides and tutorials before playing multiplayer.",1562052211,True

76561198016539117,"A fantastic game !  It actually took me some time to give this game a shot until i saw it being for sale and so i took my chance. Seriously i dont even regret that decision at all , besides some ""small"" things more for that later.  The artstyle is fantastic and i like those creatures and giants or those characters you can play,each with their own pro and cons and different stats.  Your main goal is to survive as long as possible and trying to get rid of those constant threats ,which are seasons ,giants or invasions and trying to avoid starvation or becoming insane,which can be sometimes really challenging ,but to make it even more challenging there are also players ,that tends to griefing by lighting your base on fire ,destroying stuff in there or just stand at base (,which you build to have an easier time or you play nomad style )and keep eating off your supply and ressources off in no time and trust me a lot of people do that and if you dont have people, that do stuff to surive together you find yourself rather being frustrated and annoyed from the game.  Actually there are people ,that complains that the community is toxic and ,if someone get seens/called griefing/griefer.He gets kicked rather quick from the server ,which some trolls tends to abuse.The big problem in this game are those people you play on random servers,which can make all your effort useless ,but i also gotta say ,that you barely get any information about what to cook or not ? for example. You can make crockpots to cook food. Sounds simple right ? Yes it is , if you know the proper recipes.You can get with 4 ingredints quite a lot of different foods,if you missplaced them or took too many of another one.So if you dont spent time on wiki or finding people ,that help you through the game.You might find yourself frustrated and hating on this game and may gonna say it's the worst game you ever bought for that price.  Still for that you can play with friends together and try to learn the game together ,which is a lot of fun and in general i recommend doing so to avoid randoms people,since 80% of them are trolls/griefer/eater aka just staying at base and eating everything ,thats in the fridge just like in real life :^)   However i still gonna recommend this game.Just because it's an amazing survival game with interesting ideas for characters and mechanics and lots of hidden secrets and quite a lot of stuff to discover or to learn,but there is one more thing ,that i might want to add.  This game has mod support ,which adds new characters into the game with their own functionality and QoL changes or more content in general.",1561982243,True

76561198272707439,"Oh boy, another survival game for me to boot.  This game won't hold your hand for every little things that you do. You're basically free to do whatever you want! That doesn't mean you're up for a good time, though.  Being free to do everything doesn't mean you're allowed to do everything. Especially those who don't wanna learn how to stay alive in the game.  Unless you poured some hours onto the game, expect a non-forgiving survival, an uncompromising adventure of being stranded somewhere and forced to survive, gather resources, stave off hunger, and last but not least, hug the comforting fire pit that soothe your dreary night ahead while slowly losing your sanity.  IF, and IF, you're a survivalist type, this game is not too different from your usual cup of joe. I've played some harder survival game than this, but this game is definitely a start for newcomers, if they wanna learn the hardship of survival game while playing with different characters of one and another.  Main Wickerbottom? Immediate crafting for your former days and books usage for the latter. Main Wendy? Weak in term of hand-to-hand fighting, but a go-to if you want a friendly ghost that do stuff for you. Main Wigfrid? Those mobs won't stand a chance against your valkyrie might... but you despise veggies on your diet.  There are couple of ways to survive, and that is if you're playing alone.  It's called ""Don't Starve TOGETHER"", by the way. You're not alone, if multiplayer session is your choice. People across the world, or across your sofa, will be pitted in the same land to survive. Will you cooperate together and face the darkness, or, instead of trusting them of your well-being, you annihilate them, crush them like a bug, and force them outta the server because you're too good at fighting? There are times when you just wanna login and hangout, chat a bit, play it smooth and not to worry with dying, and luckily the game provides you with that as well, phew. What was that? I hear you just wanna watch the world burn thanks to your torch? Suit yourself in 'Madness' section and wreck havoc for your silly little enjoyment. Let your inner pyromaniac go do their thing, will ya?  You main Wes? Get ready to get hanged. NO. WES = BAD. NO WES, PLEASE. FILTHY WES MAIN, STAY AWAY FROM ME, YOU DISGUSTING CREATURE.

As Willow, burn Wilson's base after stealing all of his food, then cook the food with your lighter and when you eventually go insane because the Wilson is haunting you drop your teddy bear Bernie Sander and watch it grow into a enormous size and slaughtering your living nightmares with universal healthcare.  As Wolfgang steal all of Willow's food and eat it all in one go to become mighty then go insane because of Willow's ghost but kill your living nightmares by yourself and go to youtube and make videos on why it's good to always be insane until you get killed by your living nightmares while fighting a boss and go complain on youtube and quit the game.  As Wendy use the power of your stand 「A B I G A I L」to farm spiders and hounds until Abigail decides to run off and attack a group of Mermmen but get's gang raped by them and dies again.  As WX steal and eat your friends gears that they were planning to make fridges out of and beg the Wickerbottom to electrocute you so you become even more OP, but then die when she uses the tentacle book on you because you stole gears.  As Woodie chop wood and make chests out of that wood, chop more wood and put that wood into the chest and make more chest once its full then become the werebeaver and run into the dragonfly and become beaver meat.  As Waxwell summon more stands to chop trees and fight for you but die once they die because you forgot how little HP you have.  As Wigfrid sell battle spears and helmets for meat but then die of starvation because everyone got football helmets and tentacle spikes instead.  As Webber set up your spider base in the middle of nowhere and cause a civil war but then accidentally set the nest on fire and die because there was a forest around it.  As Winona build spotlights as they are the best technology in the world and dodge a hit from Charlie while in the darkness because you craft slower than everyone else when you have less than 50 hunger and then die from starvation because it costs 5 hunger to craft above 50 hunger for a mere 0.5 second faster crafting speed.  As Wortox kill everything and eat their souls and heal with the souls and commit you are already dead by teleporting behind bosses.

76561197998594788,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly hard but fun rogue-like multiplayer game where teamwork means everything to one's survival. Taken straight from Edgar Allen Poe's fever dreams, a scientist named Wilson follows instructions given by a mysterious voice out of his radio. After having built a mysterious machine, he powers it on and it warps him to a world unknown to him. Wilson and his friends encounters many dangers in the wild as they try to find their way back home. And this time you get to enjoy the adventures online.  One thing you should know about this game is you're going to die. A LOT. Every time you die however, you'll have learned something new and you're going to come up with a new strategy to beat the game. But every time you think you've got it this time, you'll encounter new dangers and it's back to the drawing board. Don't Starve will not sit you down to read the instructions and expects you to find out what to do on your own. This steep learning curve provided me with many trips to the Don't Starve wiki. From playing with friends however, I also found value in the Steam Workshop, which comes with many fun custom characters to play, useful tools and game hacks to make the game a little less perilous. It should be said that I have never beaten the game before and it's so hard I've not even bothered with the DLC yet but it's still one of my favorite games on Steam.

Also (my friends disagree but) getting insane is probably not the best idea, in this game or otherwise.   It's really addictive gameplay that easily brings back your adventurous spirit as you navigate and explore the world around you - a world all to yourself, free for you to do whatever you want with it, provided that you stay alive.

76561198006268747,"The original Don't Starve game was a quirky and charming little game, that while a bit rough (hard and unforgiving to a point), I grew to love as I played. I'm happy to say that Don't Starve Together is more of the same exciting fun, but with friends. The game contains some new content only found in it, such as new boss creatures, and provides a different kind of fun with friends in tow. I highly recommend this game, even if you have no one to play with, but is a sure fire buy if you know someone on your list who already has it.",1561782047,True
76561198287053948,"A new world, a new adventure.  I love the dark aesthetic and the creativity that's put in each character. Each character has a different play-style, and it feels like playing a whole different game whenever you pick a different character: it makes it refreshing and very replayable. There's also quite a number of synergies between characters, and different strategies can be employed depending on which characters are available. Due to the nature of some harder creatures in the game, it is highly recommended to play with more players. Solo-playing can be fun and challenging, but it gets stale over time.  The most fun I have playing this game is with friends. Each new world feels like a rush, and each player has a significant role in the very critical stages of the early game. Teamwork is the key to survival. It's definitely a game made to be played with friends.",1561782011,True

76561198061989281,"[h1]Positives[/h1] [list] [*] Sandbox playstyle [*] Unique characters [*] Great art style [*] Never a dull moment [*] Free content and updates [/list]  [h1]Negative[/h1] [list] [*] Steep learning curve [/list]  TLDR; [strike]Don't Starve Together (DST) is a great game to feel like you are in control of your own life.[/strike] (I'm joking!) DST is great for people who wants to co-operate with others to learn how to overcome an environment that is out to get you. It is both a co-operative game and a man vs system game.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [u]Sandbox playstyle[/u] DST is like minecraft, where there are many things to do. Harvesting, fighting, exploring, maintaining a base, etc etc. It is a game that allows the player to form their own goals/tasks. It is easy to get immersed in the world and lose many hours in one session of playing.   Despite playing 40+ hours, I still feel as if that I have not seen half of what the game has to offer!  [u]Unique characters[/u] It is rare these days, to have characters that are uniquely different from each other. (That being said, the game isn't very good at explaining the difference. It might be better to read up on what each character have to offer via the wiki.) The starting characters aren't just visual but each of them bring something different to the game and subsequently the server. Some characters excel in certain areas of the game and finding which one fits an individual playstyle is certainly a game all on its own.   Each character is also defined by an instrument and it is fun to not only see but also hear the difference!  [u]Great art style[/u] I mean, have you seen the screenshots? The characters, monsters and world is styled so differently from other games that it is easy to recognise the game through screenshots. Furthermore, the game love its puns in the name. (My personal favourite is [spoiler] Deerclops[/spoiler])   [u]Never a dull moment[/u] The game world is constantly changing. There are many things to learn and the moment you think you got the hang of it, the seasons changes, and each season brings their own troubles and benefits and everything in between.   [u]Free content and updates[/u] When I first picked up the game, I wasn't expecting that there were still future content to come. Especially when it is rare these days to not just ship them as a separate DLC. A big thank you, for the huge amount of content that we currently have and new stuff to come!  [h1]Negative[/h1] [u]Steep learning curve[/u] I only really have one, and that is the fact that it is not an easy game to introduce to new players. It is hard to balance the line between handholding and wanting to pass down important tips to a friend. I love the fact there are several ways to go about acquiring knowledge.   There is the wiki route, where even the wiki itself is massive and it is very easy to get lost in there. And that with the crafting system, there are layers to many knowledge that is offered.   There is the trial and error route, which takes more time but is very addicting. The feeling of knowing or learning something without any help is a huge morale and fun boost.   Otherwise, it is a great game to play with other clueless friends and be proud as both you and them learn the ways to navigate this world!",1561780915,True

Things like longer day, more recources and of course endless mode will make it way easier for you to learn to survive in the hostile don't starve worlds.

Unlike most survival games, this one is actually challenging for you to survive. In fact, it's so challenging that it can drive players to the point of delusional paranoia and boot you from servers if they convey you as trying to sabotage their current game.

I loved it as I had hoped, but ended up playing the single player version more on PS4. My friends could not always play and I really have no desire to pay for Playstation Plus. I got the mega pack around when Wortox was released and not being able to purchase and play him really killed playing Together alone for me on PS4. It took chasing the Hamlet DLC for me to purchase a bundle on Steam and I don't regret it. All the features denied to me on PS4 I finally have access to and I am loving it. Too bad none of my friends can really play with me on this version like PS4. I suppose if there is some grand conclusion from my experience, it is that it is a great game; it is just that different platforms have pros and cons for this game and if you are interested in DLC it is for the single player version. That last part is a pro or a con depending on your preference, but I tend to be a fan of DLC for games I like.

Definitely a difficult game in the beginning, but once you get the pattern and know all the tricks there is, you're set.

Each world is randomly generated, so you run into different challenges each game. Each character has their own unique abilities and perks which adds to the randomness. Multiple layers of the game add to the fun. Explore caves and deal with different seasons. Watch out for winter as the bitter cold slowly kills you.

My personal experience with it isn't that good partially because everyone I've ever played with aren't cooperative, and when I try playing with my friends the connection goes awful. I also have had problems with the events and cosmetics system. While I like it and all, I don't like the idea of paying for things other than the base game. Events with the Forge got me upset because they were only limited time things and unfortunately they had some really cool cosmetics that were only available during the time. Other than that, it is a good entertaining game, and if you can run it, its good. Is it worth 15 dollars?

Often you need to make tough decisions like ""should I eat this meat raw and risk future starvation or risk starving now so I can cook it so it fills me up for longer?"" or ""Should I eat this to keep myself from starving at the cost of taking damage?"" or ""Should I kill this taking damage or die in the process but possibly gain some good food to keep me fed for a while?"" There are many fun and charming characters to pick from, none are better than each other but have their own advantages and disadvantages, they all have their own personality and play-styles. There are 4 seasons, each with their own challenges to overcome, freezing in the winter, insanity in the spring, overheating in the summer, and then there is autumn which is kind of your short break from the chaos to make sure you are prepared to do it all again.

Playable characters have diverse mechanics that assist and support different playstyles. The humor in this game is subtle and hilarious. The game is fairly easy to mod for as well!  The music, world, and visuals tie together with a nice, neat, pretty bow. The mechanics are simple and there is no tutorial. The game itself if built to be explored and pokes and prodded at. I have logged hundreds of hours into this game and I am still learning new things!  Don't Starve Together is challenging without being awfully rage-inducing and allows the player to find multiple different ways to survive. It is a pleasant and enjoyable experience for anyone who loves the macabre! ",1558385962,True

I mean the game does want you to play with others however when you play with more everyone has to pull their weight and build the base together or you all die as winter rolls around and no ones ready for it. There's just so much for characters to do now its overwhelming especially for just one or two people who know how to but everyone else is just consuming resources trying to keep themselves alive.

76561198079610988,"Okay, so this game might not be for you if you're more into solid goals and objectives. Survival is a long-term objective and has way too many possibilities, you know? I tried playing this game with a bunch of first-timers and they were not having a good time. But as someone who has played the single-player mode quite a bit, HOOOO BOIII am I having a heck of a time.   You learn a lot from other players, you can fight together, and you gain a sense of companionship. What better way of feeling a sense of human connection than having someone feed you some nice warm food? I died earlier today because one of my fellow players was freezing and I tried to harvest some silk to make them a winter hat. No regrets :)  I would say the game has a bit of a learning curve since there are a lot of items that can be made. It definitely helps to have some recipes in your head especially because DST does not have a pause functionality. So this tip is for you, newbies: GO FIND SOME FLINT. - Flint + twigs = Axe -> Wood -> FIRE.  - Flint + twigs = Pickaxe -> Stone (and more flint!) -> FIRE PIT. See where I'm going with this?  Also some other principles I have in mind when I play: - If you find a road, try following it. It may not lead to anything fruitful but you gain extra movement speed on roads so might as well utilize it to explore more. - Poop is your friend. Bucket of poop is a better friend! - One of the first items you might want to try making is a garland. Watch your sanity! - Read the wiki in your free time and expand your knowledge. It will help.  Today I almost survived winter. Tomorrow I hope I can stay alive to tell the story. :P",1557732535,True

I often play on endless just to revive easily and not really have to worry about consequeces (except of course when your health is capped at 25% of your original health if you don't have Booster Shots). The workshop is very interesting too, seeing as you have client side and server side mods (I personally recommend the screaming rabbits mod, it's client side and makes all of the rabbits scream like grown men).

76561198192012849,"The art style is very charming, and so is the game play and characters. Though not everything is perfectly balanced, with some things needing serious nerfs and others needing buffs, it's still a nice experience which is even better with friends. (though lets be honest, how many of us have those? ha.   ha.         yeah...)  I will be honest, the multiplayer in most steam games I've played (excluding dedicated servers) is outright @$&*. Many of the other games I play suffer unbearable lag in multiplayer. This game is not one of those. The multiplayer runs very smoothly, regardless of who you may be playing with, and regardless of if it's hosted or if it's a dedicated server. (I have a friend who lives on the other side of the world and this is the only game we can play together without lagging to death) For those of you without friends, worry not! The multiplayer is not limited to friends only. There are many public worlds that you can hop into and meet new friends in! I can't guarantee that the people you'll meet will be friendly, though. It is survival of the fittest, after all.  The world customization is one of the best I've ever seen. Slight warning though: some of the settings are touchy (setting some resources to appear more often makes them practically flood the world, and setting some to appear less might make them practically nonexistent.)  The game's server-by-server modding is a very nice feature. I don't have to enable or disable mods each time I load up a different world, and can have different configurations for each one. It doesn't have world seeds, though, so cherish any world you generate that has a great start location.  This game is by no means easy, of course. If you've played the original Don't Starve, lots of the things in the world have gotten massive health boosts, which spells out doom for people trying to play alone. If you're not too good with these levels of challenges (like me) or don't have many friends to play with (also like me until a few days ago), I'm sure the workshop has something for you.

Each character costs 2700 spools which is alot if you are new to the game and have yet to play either the events, playing events gives you loot boxes which contain 4 items each and are generally better than loot year round. I spooled both Wortox and Wormwood after unspooling all my gorge and forge skins along with my winter set/carol emote. Spools aren't that easy to obtain in normal gameplay, please work on this or make events yearly KLEI.",1554393766,True

76561198117446813,"Would Strongly Suggest!  The Dont Starve games are one of the most interesting survival games I have played. Lets start with the stats you have to maintain. Health: one of the many things that make DST difficult for new players is maintaining health, you see , you dont regain HP over time as any character. Making the only way to heal your self is with certain healing items or food. Hunger: In DST you can make a Crockpot which allows you to make all different kinds of food to help raise or even Decrease your stats. Next is the most unique and interesting stat of DST is... Sanity your right you can go insane in this game! Your Sanity decreases at night, dusk and in other scenarios! Its important to keep your Sanity levels decent or else you might be given a visit by a Shadow Creature. These Menaces are one of the only sources of Nightmare fuel a valuable and important resource, note that they aggressive but are easy to fight. Theres a Day-Night Cycle in DST aswell and during Day its normal usually but it depends on the season. In Dusk its a warning of the upcoming Night. In Night you better have a light source because it becomes pitch-black and if your caught without light the Nightmare Monster Charlie comes and if not prepared will 1 shot you. In every season is a Boss at the Beginning Middle or End. Each of the 4 bosses cannot be approached but it comes to you at the designated time. Each boss is designed to be simular to the according season. Bearger is for Autum Bearger is a Bear mixed with a Badger and will eat all of your Winter ration if not taken care of, but drops a resource unique to itself that will aid you in Winter if used right. The Deerclops is the winter boss he will usually come around the night of day 30 or 31 and will warn you of its arrival with deep breathing to warn. He will drop his eyeball that can be used for a Over-Powered hat umbrella known as the Eye-Brella. Beware of his Huge -200 Sanity per min Aura. In the Spring bosses case the Moose-Goose is optional granted that she spawns with her ducklings at certain Moose-Goose spawning locaitons. Beware of her dis-arming honk but also after death her ducklings will become hostile and attack but also granted feathers for the next seasons use.The feathers best use is for a weapon that summons tornados but also can be used to make a fan. In Summer the Antlion is your next foe. She isnt exactly necessary to fight but is a pain if not fed with trinkets and rocks or killed. If not pleased she will created sinkholes or if underground earthquakes, warned but the screen shaking. Interesting fact the Singleplayer version of DST known as just DS (Dont Starve) the original Summer boss was Antlion but she dosent come after you like the others but beware shes a raid boss which also means shes a stronger boss.  Next and last subject is The Seasons them selves an the dangers that follow. Autum: known to be a calm passing period no real dangers. Winter: Extreme cold, if not supplied with warmth, will kill you easily. Spring: known to be a harsher passing period due to the constant rain which can cause Freezing and Insanity. Summer: Extremely Hot, the heat isnt a problem alone wild fires can happen at random causing your base to engulf in flames in not prepared with a Ice-Flingomatic (Fire exstinguishing machine.)  That was a little bit Info compared to the games size (This Review dosent include Combat Methods, Charecter guides and Cave Info)  So I hope you Purchase Dont Starve Together if you can!

That being said, this game is PHENOMENAL. The art style is to die for, the themes for when you get into boss fights, ambient music, how each character has their own instrument are incredible. There are so many little nuances that Klei inserts into the game that makes me revere it so highly, it's the small attention to detail in the game that makes it so fantastic.   This game has quite a bit of a learning curve. You'll start out, and try to survive (probably rather unsuccessfully) and learn about what different mobs do, what certain structures do, which ones to build, and so forth. The beauty in this game is within its learning curve. It's designed for you to learn from your mistakes in a comical world where at first nearly everything can kill you, it can almost be discouraging. This matters so much however once you reach the point where you can actually survive. The amount of reward you feel, the amount of work that's paid off is immense and it feels as though now that you've explored the game intimately enough you can really have some fun. Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that unlike other games where the player grinds to try to achieve something and feel successful, the fun for DST is experiencing and learning curve, as well as the payoff in the end. Even after you can survive, there's much more to do! There are boss fights and caves and the ruins, all things where the game continues to challenge the player.

Anyway if your looking for something casual with not much brain drain, this is not the game your looking for.. get the original instead if you want a less brutal experience..   I for one just don't understand why some games like this are just so dang brutal like gebus crist were not all uber gamers etc like settle down with the dmg n hp values omg!!  and like honestly it looks like a game for kids.. its totally not.. their are some really horrifying aspects to it..   this game is not relaxing.. and neither is the original.. but dangit.. their both good..

Eventually you instead of starving together learn how to not starve together. Starvation isnt really the problem to be honest.

76561198064753584,"TL;DR review: this is a 10/10 masterpiece and sits near the top of the best all-time indie and survival genres. If you don't have the game and it is on sale, buy it. If it's not on sale, it's still underpriced, and well worth the cost. I'll continue a more detailed review below.  The outstanding singeplayer ""Don't Starve"" is strengthened even more with the addition of multiplayer, here in the ""Don't Starve Together"" variation. If I were asked to name a great game that becomes even better with friends, this would probably be my top recommendation.  As you can see from the images, the art style is rather dark, yet charming. This theme remains consistent throughout all aspects of the game, combining perfectly to impress audiences of all ages and aesthetic preferences. Despite having the semblance of a nice little relaxing game to play, the game does not hold your hand, and provides minimal guidance.  You are thrown into the wilderness with many challenges and dangers to face. Don't expect to do well without a lot of trial-and-error. And even after you've figured out how to make light and avoid dying in the darkness, how to hunt, gather, farm, and cook enough food to maintain your hunger for a little while longer, the game will throw new challenges in your face that you probably will not be ready for.  The gameplay is deceptively simple -- gather supplies, build structures, craft equipment, flee from or fight monsters, and ultimately, survive. This pairs perfectly with the game's unique form of difficulty. The game does not seem so difficult until a new problem appears and you have to figure out how to solve it. When faced with that problem, your survival will be determined by a few principles: having enough knowledge of the game to deal with the problem effectively, anticipating and preparing for this problem, and either being creative enough or improvising to solve this problem. To a lesser extent, the game does have a small mechanical skillgap, but the mechanics are simple for the most part. The only real mechanical challenge will be learning how monsters move and determining when to attack, dodge, and run from them.  Ultimately, the game will push both your character and you to your limits. Even when you get lucky, you'll probably still face an exhilirating near-death experience. Otherwise you'll die and learn new things about the game, and be better prepared to face that challenge in the future.   Don't Starve is on par with a small list of masterpiece games that beat you down for your mistakes without making it feel like the game cheated you. Each mistake being preventable, your blunders truly feel like opportunities to learn how to build yourself back up later on.",1547176718,True

You'll place a campfire when it's highlighted green but I won't place sometimes. The solution is to play the game slowly and be careful. As I want to have a thrilling game, I refuse to play at the dreadfully slow rate the game wants you to.  Edit: Just generated a world that I couldn't find saplings or twigs in and died first night due to inablity to make light. Very rare bug, but this needs fixed. Games that force you into close calls can't randomly kill you.  TLDR; Great game but will unfairly screw you over if you don't play slowly, so game's not for everyone.

76561198127693034,"This game is definitely not easy, it'll be difficult to learn and master to kite and kill enemies. Be prepared to die a lot at the beginning, you can rollback your world 1 day if you're playing alone to prevent resetting your world or use commands.  There is 4 seasons with their own unique bosses with powerful and interesting boss specific drops. There is also raid bosses that are very difficult, they can be killed alone but will be extremely difficult at the beginning. Each session also has it's own challenges, such as overheating during summer, frog rain in spring, freezing during winter, etc. which requires you to acquire particular items in order to survive.  The gardening system (farms) are useful to have in order to grow crops which you'll require for unique dishes made using the crock pot (Don't use the basic farm, use the advanced one). crops such as the dragon fruit can be used to make one of the best source of healing in the game, but retrieving the crop you want is difficult as the fruit/veg that appears will be random and certain fruit/veg have a higher chance to appear compared to other ones making it difficult to retrieve certain fruits and vegetables you want. Once you retrieve the crop you want, I'd recommend feeding it to the bird in the cage to get that fruit/vegs seeds in order to grow it.   The combat system will be difficult to master, you have to learn to kit enemies which is moving and dodging pretty much. You get great satisfaction when you learn to kill more difficult stuff.   Each season (Autumn, Spring, Spring, Summer) has it's own difficulty, Summer and Winter being the most difficult.   Each character have their own unique perks and advantages and disadvantages which change the way you would play them in comparison to the other characters, for example (one of the characters cannot sleep, two are seen as monsters meaning neutral creatures are hostile, one can only eat meat based food only, etc.) Certain characters are much more efficient at doing another characters role, I'd recommend testing each character to see which suits your play style. (I recommend Wilson during the start to learn the game, unless you looked at guides)     You can retrieve mods that improve on the UI, provide you with a mini map, display your temperature and more. There is mods that add new characters, biomes, structure and more as well. These can be used to make the game easier or more difficult. (Be aware that mods can be out of date)  Cooking foods is certainly fun, but certain foods are much more efficient at providing health, sanity and/or hunger due to the value they provide and how much more easier and efficient they are to make. Certain foods have effects such as raising your temperature. I recommend knowing different types of foods rather than learning what's the best for restoring certain stats.   There is much more to say about how great this game is.",1545179577,True

The game itself is more enjoyable with a friend, but this doesn't stop you from enjoying it on your own. Working together as a team is a good thing in this game, and each season brings on new challenges and creatures, so you're always on the go strategising your next move! It's always been fun to talk about the equipment you may need or where a good position to set up camp is. Coming back to the single player aspect, You can play on your own in Don't Starve Together, just as you can in Don't Starve, and I made the misake of purchasing Don't Starve before Don't Starve Together, thinking they were essentually two different offers. They're not, so I would also recommend not purchacing Don't Starve as there's no real point.

Ive never liked survival games, because they always felt flat. Like when you had some food and water, all other stuff was just boring and all the same, there just wasnt anything to do and nothing interesting. But this games takes you into the story, you never feel bored because theres always something new behind the corner, even after 60 hours i have seen basically nothing. So much stuff, and everything looks fun and cool, drawing is amazing in this game, quite frankly, i dont even know about any cons. Its an amazing game, and with all the events, updates, and the fact that when you buy the game you get extra copy, theres nothing bad to say about it.

The survival-crafting genre is probably one of my least favourite, though I have an extensive library of games related to it, but Don't Starve is one of the few I have played that genuinely gave me the ""just one more day/night"" mentality, something that I can't remember any other game of the genre doing for me. It has such a unique set of charming art, intuitive mechanics, challenging gameplay, and captivating air of discovery that make it an essential title to play. The multiplayer aspect of Don't Starve Together / The Forge only further extends the enjoyment and replayability of this game, as you get to share in the struggle and misery of the Don't Starve world with someone else, making for plenty of shenanigans. This game really was a pleasant surprise for me, and though it is an older series now it remains a refreshing experience even in 2018.

And then you play as Willow and burn everything they make, because that's what multiplayer survival is all about: betrayal. At least, it is for me. But I'm getting off track.

Graphics: 92% -- A unique, unforgetable art style that is brilliantly drawn. Gameplay: 85% -- Excellent gameplay with great mechanics. Like insanity. And starving. Story: 73% -- The world of DST, like the original game, has some of the weirdest, most interesting lore I've seen.

The art style is a nice twist in my opinion and i personally like it. if you dont then thats just your preference. The game its self is solid. you'll enjoy not knowing how to build anything and no tutorial or tips or what your even doing. its all a big learning experience by trial and error. which adds to the fun of the game and makes you feel accomplished when you figure things out. The crafting system is actually well done. though youre not told what does what the crafting is solid. every craftable item tells you exactly what items it takes to craft the item you want its just a matter of finding where and how to get the material needed.   The bad thing about dont starve together ive found is the community unfortunately. a lot of people are picky. if you set certain settings in your world and make some freinds while playing and they dont like it, theyll most likely get mad at you, tell you your trash and then unfriend you on steam. Most of the community hve been playing this game for some time and are not noob friendly people. I would reccomend making your own private server first and learning the ropes then after you learn some things make a public server or hop into one and lthen ask for tips from people. if you go into it knowing nothing people will get very mad.   other than that the game is great. for what it is id give it a 9 out of 10. its a definite buy if you like this style of game.",1541825459,True

On a laptop (not a high end gaming one) it didnt respond for a couple of minutes when loading the game, joining a game, or hosting a game. But, once it was loaded the game played flawlessly. Even on bad wifi, you can still play offline by playing LAN if you wish to play with others or if you want to play alone you could play in the middle of the sahara dessert if you wished.  The game does not push microtransactions upon the player, and microtransactions wont give players unfair advantages as they are purely cosmetic as far as i can tell.

76561198059389066,"[Introduction] Don't starve together (And Don't Starve) is hands down, one of the best games I have played. I've been with Don't starve since the beginning with early access, it was the second game I bought on steam so I've always loved this game. But this game is 100% worth 15$ it's fun with friend, or without. I do recomend going into this game blind, maybe watch a video that lets you understand some of the mechanics but try to go in unspoiled.  [Gameplay Overview] Don't Starve Together is a permadeath multiplayer game that has you balance between health, hunger, and sanity and trying to survive as long as possible aswell as acheiving goals. The gameplay is fun and challenging as you have to learn everything from experience, I remeber the first time playing don't starve game and knowing nothing about it, from the first [spoiler] hound attack,[/spoiler] all the way to fighting [spoiler]deerclops[/spoiler] it was horrifying but I learned from those expeirences and learned how to deal with them, this has been improved on in Don't Starve together as you can experience the game with friends! If you find the game too hard you can increase the ammount of food and resources and decrease the ammount of enemies as the world is fully customisable, you can increase the ammount of enemies to lots, or make the world always dark.   [Art Style] The art-style is one of the best I've ever seen, it captures the mood of the game so well and is beautifully animated serious props to Klei as the art-style is what seperates this game from all those other early access survival games.  [Pros] -This game has a great art style, and overhaul theme to it. As you slowly go insane you seen halucinations, hear voice, and slowly watch the world distort as you are plunged into darkness -The game is hard, which I like hard, I like a challenge other people may not like this but I personally love a challenge   [Cons] -Game can get boring without friends, but really depends on the person -Game can get repetitive after you play it for long periods of time   [Final Thoughts] This game has a tone of replayability as there is lots to explore, and even a workshop that has tons of content that includes character mods, new weapons, and even DLC's that have been ported from Don't Starve Standalone. I've gotten over 250 hours of enjoyment fo $15 I'd says a solid 10/10",1540715947,True

Since I didn't have a steam account at that time, I purchased it on my brothers account. Once Klei released Dont starve together, I was hooked. It is updated a good amount of times a year, and has a unique artstyle I love. Dont Starve Together is a amazing survival game to play with your friends, and even supports mods to create your own experience. It has events every once in a while, to add some spice to the play style of the game. Even if you dont want to play co-op, there are many different options to change how you play including pvp to allow a more competitive playstyle. Dont Starve and Dont Starve together are an experience that I beleive most people would enjoy, and ever since Dont Starve Together was released in 2016, I am stilled not bored of it, and play it with all my friends.

76561198031673076,"Compared to the regular Don't Starve the multiplayer version delivers a more challenging experience. Everyone needs to gather way more resources, communicate with each other and team up to withstand dangerous situations. A larger group has a better chance in defeating monsters but in the same time requires a lot more food to survive which balances the gameplay pretty well. All the characters have unique characteristics which can deliver huge benefits for the team or set them up for more trouble. For example Webbers spider nest can be a good source of silk and meat but after a few cycles there is a chance that it will spawn the Spider Queen. Everyone also gets a penalty in the form of a constant sanity drain if a member of the group died and is floating around as a ghost. The playerbase is usually friendly but if you join a server that is about to hit the winter season you will come across the rule of limited trust and might not get directions to the main base. This might sound a bit hostile but is just a little insurance against people who jump into a server and decide to destroy everything you and your team worked hard on. The best thing you can do is to gather some experience in single player, send the extra copy of Don't Starve Together to one of your Steam friends and jump with him / her into a private server. This way you will avoid trolls and in the same time learn about the new content that wasn't available in the classic game.",1537174722,True

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

The game delivers a challenging start to new players but this can be counteracted with the ability to increase and decrease certain aspects of the game world such as being able to increase the amount of food drops to monsters. The game feels rewarding after learning how to kill a new monster or surviving a new season and finally getting past the last milestone that you and your friends. The game falls short on teaching the player new stuff but that only drives players to learn for them self without a set by set guide on how to play.

But I digress. This game despite the lack of SW content provides what is in my opinion a much more robust version of RoG (and more) that truly provides a challenge to those playing alone or in a large group of inexperienced players. There is frankly a lot more to do in this game than even Don't Starve single player with RoG installed that is refreshing after playing over 150 hours of the other game feeling like you've run out of things to do unless you link to SW but that's a whole 'nother story.

But DST is great it only needs free events and updates that add 2 major things and thats it. All im asking for is to update DS to be like DST.

Don't Starve works excellently as a singleplayer game but something about playing it with other people can make the game significantly more fun.  ATTENTION: DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT HAVING MORE PEOPLE WILL MAKE THE GAME EASIER It doesn't get easier and in fact gets to be much harder in many ways. Sure you can have two things being done at once, and fight together, but you also need to worry about 2 sanity meters, 2 hunger meters, 2 health meters, and getting both people equiped for fights as you can't just equip one person for a fight. Having more people means you get to do stuff faster but have equally more stuff to do. Also be careful as due to the fact that you are now going through materials faster you're going to be chopping a lot more trees down and the Keeper of the Forest will not like you for that.

76561198139472718,"Don't Starve Together is a sequel/expansion to Don't Starve. As such, it comes with lots of small improvements to the original game. However, having played both versions, the only real game-changing difference this iteration has is its titular multiplayer feature. It's a great game to play with friends, and it's brought countless hours of fun in both the gameplay itself and the interactions which occur as a result of it. However, this game lacks the adventure mode of the original, which makes the gamplay kind of repetitive and doesn't give players an end goal to work towards, which might iscourage some people. If you're okay with the Minecraft-esque objective of simply ""stay alive and get good"", this game has a similar approach to progression. Bottom line is, this is a good game, but it's not a substitute to the original Don't Starve experience. I prefer the original as far as gameplay goes, but if you have some friends who also like the game, the ability to play and interact with them is well worth the price of admission.",1530819796,True

Me and my friend both bought our own copies even if you can gift a friend it for free, more support to the devs, they clearly care about their work!   The Klei team as put so much love and effort into these games, the art style is unique and interesting, the gameplay lasts hours. Once Don't Starve Together came out, I needed to have it, and I finally do. I play tons with my close friend and it's become an often thing for us since we don't see each other much besides online. She was new to the game, and had never heard of Don't Starve, so I thought I'd introduce her too it. She loves it, and it runs smoothly on her (Trash, Potato, it's b a d) ""computer"". Both of us agree that it's a great game, the story is interesting, the art is wonderful, and whole game is honestly so different and fun. I'm normally nervous to play co-op games since I'm mostly bad at them, but for once i'm the player who teaches instead of dies constantly! The events are a new fun twist and are extremely challening but fun as well.  The point is, if you're looking for a new and unique, challenging experience with your friends, this is the game for you!  A little fun add on, we're addicted, we freak out whenever something new happens, you have no idea how loud the gasps of seeing a meese/geese land right next to us on the first day of spring were. Our little base is going well, besides almost burning it down... she has a great time yelling ""BURN"" with willow and then laughing like a mad man, as she plays as her (can't blame her). I have a problem with picking roses, I see one, it's mine, I don't care about the health I loose. She has a problem with rocks, she must mine a l l the rocks. I can't say we without it seeming like i'm talking about webber since I play as him, it's funny though when it does happen.

Don't Starve is a game where you will try to survive and its not easy because everything in the world will try to kill you. You will fight monsters, try to manage your food so you don't starve later, collect materials to craft better gear and gadgets, and try to survive in harsh environments like winter season.   You will starve, you will freeze and a psycho deer cyclops will destroy your hard earned home but Don't Starve is good because of these challenges, at first you will fail but you will try different strategies and will learn at the end. If you still didn't try this game i suggest trying it, One of the best Co op games you will find on Steam.",1529840570,True

76561198183183534,"This is a spectacular game. I've played since beta. The only complaints I have is that the internet and ping at my house is terrible, and yet I can't play the events even solo without intense lag. This would be fine during last year's forge, which I didn't favor much, but this year is different. This year (2018) is the Gorge Event. I'd love a few things to change about the game that I will include in the following list. -Each event you get to pick a free character and all their items, but only one ( I'd really like Winnona, this event is her only skin of her's I like and I feel it would make the whole community feel more loved if they got to pick a free skin of their choice to be able to remember the event every time they played) - The event ( now that there is a leveling system) would be optional to play at anytime, without the chests for leveling, but still gaining xp, to show what events you've played and be a nice reward for a new system of all year, all events. - I know this is a lot, and I'm only a single person reviewing, but I really like the farming mechanic and the alternate ways for cooking and think you should add them to the hamlet dlc for the original game.   General Ideas ( not as important as the other recommendations) -add claiming territory in pvp servers - maybe make it so if you get a common item in a regular chest you get 2 or so, making the trade inn more of a common thing to use instead of just people buying commons hoping for a more rare item to sell back on the market. - Tree house villages would be cool - more amazing puns, I loved the Prime-Ape in SW - You should add a demo/Free trial version so more people can expierience the game -not sure if i spelled that right - You should add events where people submit fan art of each character and the most popular ones get added as skins   In general this is fantastic, it would be cool if you considered some of the ideas in my first recommendations, but all in all don't trouble yourselves too much, you have made such a great masterpiece and I would hate to pressure you to change it or stress any of you at Klei out, Have a nice rest of the summer and enjoy it while you can.

While a lot of basic stuff (like crafting, some cooking recipies, gathering of Ressources like wood, stone, flint, ...) in the game is totally intuitive other things do require regular visits to a WIKI or some hardcore search-engine usage.  The characters all have their own advantages and disadvantages so they have to be played differently and I do recommend to use a mix of them when playing coop.   Don't Starve Together can be played alone, but the balancing has been adjusted for multiplayer although a collection of mods (for readjusting the balancing once more) can be used should you wish to play this version alone.  Fighting is easier for the host (especially against bosses) since latency issues can cause other players to recieve hits they would otherwise easily avoid. Avoiding hits is essential in boss fights so that can be quite a serious problem. Buuuut you might argue that bossfights are supposed to be difficult and they are still managable, even with that problem.   I love how many adjustable options there are for setting up a new world, like the abundance of Ressources, Enemy Spawnrates, Eventtimers, et cetera.

Don't Starve Together has unique Tim Burton style graphics and completely unique from any other game. This has to be the best survival game out there for a lot of reasons, but the main reasons are its ability to keep you going. You can't just stand around; you have to keep moving, collecting resources and food, and preparing for Winter if it's Autumn. To continue on, it becomes addicting and challenging real fast. Some people say this game is awful and one of the reasons is that there is no tutorial. Well, guess what bucko? Minecraft doesn't have a tutorial either. Tutorials aren't always necessary. Last, of all, the game has a combat system of prediction and strategy. Each monster and animal have their own way of defeating them which makes combat different for each thing you fight.

The difficulty of this game is nice too, its very hard in the beginning and later when you learn the basics of this game you will find stuff much easier. graphics 9.5/10  The events are very good thing to spend time on, it requires time, speed and teamwork to achieve the best results. For now i am playing ""The Gorge"" Event and i need to say it is very hard but i love it! You never get bored by the content of the game because there is a lot of stuff you can learn. I hardly learned anything without the FanWIKI of DST, the game doesnt explain you the mechanics or has any tutorial for you. It just throws you in the wilderness and you need to find out how to survive. It can take you many games until you know what to do. Content 9/10  The multiplayer is very fun, you can play with your friends and join a server with up to 64 people! You can adjust the server with everything e.g How many mobs spawn,how long is a season,how big is the map etc. You can also add mobs to make your gameplay much easier like health bars, map huds and many more! I actually played this game for 4-5 days straight without getting bored. Fun 9/10  And the last thing is the price, i believe that the price is very good and if its on sale...well you gotta buy it 100% . Also you dont need to buy Dont starve and dont starve together cause the single player version comes with multiplayer (unless buying for a friend too). Price 9/10  I believe this game is totally worth it if your are a fan of survival games with hard difficulty, i've been looking for this kind of game for ages and i dont regret the price that i payed for. the price is totally equal with the content  Avarage Mark: 9.5/10 - Matt Approves",1529353543,True

The game runs very well even on lower-end computers due to the art style and general design of the game. Below are some key qualities that make me love this game.  [h1][b]Random world generation[/b][/h1]  Every time you start a new game, the world will be randomly generated. You can edit the settings on how the world should be and what it should feature (see next point regarding this). This results in every world being unique and you can experiment with different play styles.  [h1][b]Customizable world[/b][/h1]  There is an absolutely amazing modding comunity for Don't Starve Together, but more importantly, every world you start is fully customizable in what it should feature. Here you can specify if there should be more of a type of creature, like rabbits, for example, to be able to gather more food, or less of a type of monster, like less or no hound attacks if you are struggling to survive. You can also adjust what season you start at, how long the days or nights are, the frequency of thunderstorms and many more.  [h1][b]Unique setting and eerie atmosphere[/b][/h1]  As mentioned earlier, the art style is very different to what we have nowadays with games. The story and setting of the game are shrouded in mystery and new-comers to the game will be scared of the monsters and how to fight them. The game mechanics of the darkness, sanity and seasons are fun ways of forcing the player to always do something and not just hide in a base and try to survive. You must be proactive in this game and learn to utilize the different resources, creatures and more importantly, sanity.  [h1][b]Free events[/b][/h1]  Right now The Gorge event is running which came completely free to the owners of the game. This is my first event and it is fun. It feels as a sort of 'big' mini-game, where you play in a completely different setting with other mechanics as the main game, keeping things fresh and giving the players opportunities to get new and wonderful cosmetics.  [h1][b]Conclussion[/b][/h1]  I haven't played this game for as long as I have wanted to, but it is an absolute blast to play. Every world feels unique and it is fun to always try new ways of playing. Definitely get this game, it is worth it for the full price which isn't that expensive anyways!",1529307814,True

76561198046455310,A very fun game. I really enjoy the artstyle and I think that it is of excellence that compares to no other. The characters all have their own unique abilities. For example the spider can lay eggs and grow a silk beard. The game is quite a challenge and the title should definitely not be taken lightly. Starvation and dehydration are the biggest enemies in this game. Forget packs of hungry hounds or losing sanity and being killed by shadow animals. You will always be on the hunt for food and water. This game has come very far and is still pushing through. A definite yes from me.,1529268290,True

76561198255156918,"Hi people. This review is dedicated to Don't Starve Together. In this game I've been playing for more than 200 hours, and what can I say about this game? This is a multiplayer with unusual graphics and gameplay. After a few hours of playing, you will understand that everything is not so simple, today you are going to chop down a tree, tomorrow the tree is chopping you off. This game is designed to play with friends, because if you decide to go to the server, you will understand that there are either noobs or players who in every way want to spoil the game. So it's better to play with a good company. Personally, it's difficult for me to play with my friends, because they often like to have fun, because of this all problems turn into laughter, and later into the death of the whole team. I hope you are luckier than me. Have a good game, and a little luck!!!",1529235346,True

Typically I am a graphics guy. I love (unlike a lot of gamers) the big triple titles. Needless to say, this is not my typical cup of tea. However, this game has depth like you won't believe. Just when you think you found the bottom of the rabbit hole you will figure out more you can do. I love the limitless nature. The freedom to go deep, or just run around and have fun. I would buy this game at full price because it's already a great value. If you get it on sale, you stole from the company.

It uses the theme of ""horror"" well by incorporating it into the gameplay using insanity and the use of fire at nighttime, while the cartoon element takes out some of the ""horror"" aspect to make it much more spooky and playable for a larger player-base. That being said, the gameplay is really quite fun and fast-paced, making it so that you have to think about what you want to do next given that you only have so much time in each day.

76561198272383813,"I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is currently on the fence about buying it. After having spent close to 300 hours playing this game, I have yet to become bored with the gameplay, due in part to the wonderful job Klei is doing with special events, as well as the mods made by fellow players.  If you have enjoyed Don't Starve, you will highly enjoy this game, as it expands on the content found in the first game. If you haven't played Don't Starve, well, I really don't know what to say. Just go play it, then come back here. Now on to the things I really like. First, the art style. This game does an amazing job of making everything look whimsical, yet still somewhat threatening. Second, the game does not hold your hand or tell you what you should do next, nor does it explictly say what creatures will kill you. Third, this game can be brutal. If you and your friends die with no way to resurect, than that's it. You will have to start over in a new world from scratch. Can it be frustrating and rage inducing at times? Yes. Will you find yourself dying due to stupid mistakes? Yes. But over time and with enough patience, you will learn from your mistakes and become a better player due to your failures. Trust me, it feels really good to finally kill a boss after dying from it several times and being forced to start from scratch again and again. Furthermore, Klei has done a tremendous job of adding updates to the game to keep it fun, i.e The Forge. Overall, this is an amazing game, and I highly recomend it to anyone who likes survival/crafting games, or is simply looking for a challenge.  Nominated for the Steam Awards",1523431577,True

Now I must say the artwork is absolutely fan-flippin-tastic.  Love the fact that the characters' voices are replaced with instrument sounds instead of real voices.  The gameplay is fun, learning how to do specifc things and discovering new things constantly as well with enemies and tools and crafts.  Not to mention how interesting it is how the characters all ended up in the area.  I rate the game 9/10.

The unlockables are great, with playtime rewarded with random drops of varying rarity, and special items that come around with each new seasonal event. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who are looking for a solid, enjoyable multiplayer game to share with friends.

76561198054636867,"I don't understand why this is a standalone but regardless it's a super fun game. The only issue I can say I have with Don't Starve is that it's probably one of the longer roguelike cycles which is probably intentional. It takes so long to get a half way decent camp set up that when you die, it doesn't have a pull to get back into the fray of it all, you feel you've genuinely lost all that stuff, which depending on your outlook may or maynot feel like a waste of time.

Highly recommended, I'll sing this games praises whenever I get the chance. It's provided hours of entertainment, solo and with friends. The first time I became totally self sustainable I was so pleased with myself, and then promptly died to Deerclops (beware winter!). I'm not sure what it is about Don't Starve, but I find myself itching to play it every few weeks and then will end u playing it for two days and barely doing anything else. It's been a favorite passtime for me and a couple friends in recent months, cooperating and getting each other killed has been a riot.

The only thing I have noticed that bugs me a bit after 250 hrs is that certain characters are much better than others. I feel like a little tweaking has been in order for a while now. Other than that I was very happy with all of the regular updates to the game and the Forge was a lot of fun.  Update: For people with questions about this game in 2019. It is a great time to give this game a try if you've been on the fence about it. Klei's road map for DST in 2019 is very promising. New characters and re-works for current characters that need it are finally coming. Klei has also promised new content outside of characters and character changes. New biomes are set to come out a little later this year.   Why start now if the content isn't out yet? DST has a decent learning curve and getting an early start should put you in a good place to be comfortable with the game as the content drops month by month.,1520627878,True

It's a great way to see how well your friends and yourself will last together. With more people come more challenges as food is scarce and resources can be hard to gather. Like normal Don't Starve, you are able to adjust the worlds to better suit your needs.  Beware as Giants roam the lands, and caves hold unknown terrors.  The only issue with Don't Starve Together is the fact that Caves require their own server, meaning that whoever is hosting has to have an ok PC to host both the above ground and Caves servers. Also having a strong internet connection is recommended if you have more than 3 people on at a time.  The story essentially takes place after Winston beats Maxwell and assumes the chair, though that is really a minor detail.

76561198051826456,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  Few games match the charm and lovely, whimsical appeal of Don't Starve. But, visual uniqueness aside, Don't Starve is a deceptively deep survival game. You will likely die many times, but after each death you learn something new, and you will take that knowledge with you into the next world. Eventually, there will come a point where you have such a thorough understanding of the many different gameplay elements of the game that death will seem like some distant memory.   Indeed, once you've established a consistent means of obtaining food, and have fortified your base heavily enough, there will be little to threaten your survival. At which point, the game will evolve and you'll be able to enjoy the deeper layers of crafting and the challenges of obtaining that unique new item or weapon. And, if you've reached a point, like me, where you seem to have obtained everything you will ever need... And have no threats to your survival... You can just play the game in your off time to relax. There is something reallly therapeutic about this game.   From the moment I started playing the single player game, 'Don't Starve', I was hooked. I played that for hours and hours, and was reluctant to dive into 'Don't Starve Together' as I had assumed it was a multiplayer focused game, intended only for those that played with others. But I am here to tell you, I was wrong.  By all means, it's a fantastic game to play with friends. I played with my brother for a short while and I have to say, I enjoyed it a lot. The challenge of survival, of needing to obtain enough food to survive the night, was heightened with two mouths needing to be fed. However, just like in the original Don't Starve, this game is a joy to play alone, too.  So, please don't let the title fool you. Sure, it's a fantastic multiplayer game. But I have played many, many hours and am still living on the first world I created - day 400 something. All by myself.  What's more, the developers clearly have a great passion for this unique world they have created. They continually update the game, and have begun implementing entire new game modes to allow players to experience a whole new aspect of 'Don't Starve'. The Forge was an absolute blast and I eagerly await its return, and the arrival of new multiplayer experiences.  So, please, do yourself a favour. If you enjoy survival games, you owe it to yourself to check out Don't Starve.",1517137377,True
76561198000785750,"A wonderful survival simulator that becomes exceptional when played with friends. It's open to mod support (but this can make the game unstable) which allows for even more end game content. While none of the systems are terribly deep, there's a lot here to keep you busy for 10's of hours. I've seen most of what the game has to offer in my 66 hours of co-op fun, but a close friend of mine has 500+ hours in the game.

The devs are still active even thought they are also working on Oxygen Not Included. When we got this game, we were concerned that it would be too scary for the kids who were very little at the time. We were thrilled to discover that you can remove or avoid almost everything that might bother them.

76561198104112417,"UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.    When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.  Starting off: Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless  Survival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.  Wilderness: When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.  Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a ""Jury-Rigged Portal"" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the ""Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart"" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)  Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).  Characters -  Wilson:  Pros -  Grows a beard  Cons - None.  Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.  Willow:  Pros -  Doesn't Take fire damage Starts with a lighter (Infinte torch)  Cons -  When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires Can Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.  Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.  Wolfgang:  Pros -  Gets stronger on a full stomach Has more hp  Cons -   1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach Moves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach Loses more sanity in Night / Afternoon  Ah, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only ""Power up"" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.  Wendy:  Pros -  Has a ghost sister Doesn't lose much sanity in dark  Cons -  Does -.25% Less damage than all characters Loses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in  Wendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.  WX78:  Pros -   Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled / Stale and take no penalty. Can be charged by lightning Can eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.  Cons -  Takes Damage in the rain Starts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)  WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.  Wickerbottom:  Pro -  Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked. Able to craft her own books Starts off with 2 Papyrus.  Cons -  Can't Sleep Takes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food  Wickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.  The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.  Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.

Don't Starve Together, or DST, continues to be a lovable mess that is extremely enjoyable and endearing to play.  A survival game at its core, it is challenging enough to make certain players to starve to death without proper care and knowledge on how it can be survivable and joyfull. It is a harsh learning curve and always a challenge from the start, which makes it highly replayable.  Further supporting ""replayability"" are the characters present in the game, which, hold the game together by their diferent atributes, perks and flaws. Making the game easy in some aspects, however, hard on others.  Has a final point that I personally love about the game is the artwork itself.

I prefer it over the original Don't Starve, because the high tension gameplay makes for an entertaining ""shared trauma"" kind of experience... which is a good thing!  The best way to play is just to start up a game with all defaults and learn the hard way (by dying). Once you get a few game overs, I recommend tweaking the world generating parameters to better suit the kind of world you'd prefer to play in. Be warned, there are spoilers in the World Generator parameters, if you haven't played much.  I played this game with my wife, and while I love it, she gets a bit stressed when we get attacked by ravenous wolves (happens pretty frequently), so we don't play as much as I'd like.",1514324945,True

I mostly play Don't Starve and not Don't Starve Together, but from my short experience with this specific version, I can say that it is just as good as the original. The graphics are unique and interesting, yet also high quality. The monsters and characters are all unique. Each character has pros and cons and are balanced.  My only issue with it is that some of the bosses are far harder than they should be. As in, they have way more health than they really should; the Dragonfly, who was already hard to defeat, now has 27000 health, which is overdoing it in my opinion. The Toadstool has even more health and doesn't even have half-decent drops. However other bosses like the bearger, deerclops and moose/goose are balanced.

[/b]   I think [i] Don't Starve Together [/i] might be one of the best survival games in the past decade...  you can tell a lot has been put into this indie game and the devs update it REGULARLY!   [h1] Gameplay [/h1]   So you can begin your game by picking a cast of some pretty unique playable characters with their own little 'perks' or 'starting items/equipment' that can synergize well with each other (early game/later game).  But if it's your first time, [b] just pick whoever you think LOOKS COOL/INTERESTING! [/b]  [i] It does start off slow, but the more time you put into it, the more rewarding it is! [/i]   You'll then start of your adventure by spawning in a random location on the map.  After that, it's all up to you to [i] collect, gather, cook and kill [/i] and do whatever it takes to survive!    [i] If you get really confused or just don't know what to do, there are always guides and the Don't Starve Wiki! [/i]   You can unlock some [b] cool cosmetic skins [/b] just by playing or you can buy it from the Steam Market/in-game store!   - Although I haven't played much Solo, I thoroughly enjoy my time playing it [b] with friends [/b] - as most people would recommend doing so too!    [h1] Performance [/h1]   - In terms of PC requirements, you can pretty much run this game on any computer without needing a next-gen graphics card. I have played it on my potato 2013 laptop with Integrated graphics and it runs pretty well!   [b] HOWEVER, hosting a server will take some resources from your computer, so if you have a potatoaster PC, I suggest letting someone else host! [/b]  - There are a [i] few lag/ping spikes [/i] when playing multiplayer, however, but as long as you have a decent internet connection you should be fine.  Overall, the game does run fairly well/smooth FPS-wise.   [h1] Graphics/Visual Style [/h1]   - This game has a very distinct, artistic visual style that seems so [b] fitting [/b]. It has a cast of very whacky/funny, whimsical characters that gives off a very [i] Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton [/i] feel to it. I personally LOVE IT and is one of my favorite things about this game!   [b] AUDIO - SOUND EFFECTS: [/b]  Again, a lot of the things sound very quirky and has a lot of personality in it.  From gathering grass to your character talking - it is very imaginative yet distinct so you know know what's happening.   All in all, you can tell it doesn't take stuff [b] too [/b] seriously and there are some funny/quirky/cute things that are quite cheesy.  Although there is an underlying darker theme (the Darkness, starvation, survival) in terms of the characters' lore/backstory.   -   I cannot stress enough how fun it is to play with friends/other players, as you need a lot of micro-management, resource management and teamwork/communication to survive for a long time.  Of course, a lot of the resources that spawn are dependent on [b] RNG [/b], but [b] THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE GAME FUN/CHALLENGING! [/b]  Good job, Klei!
